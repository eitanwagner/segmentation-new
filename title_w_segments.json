"], ["life before the war", "Just before the war started, we lived in Belgrade. And we were quite well off, I would say. My father and my uncle owned jointly a factory. Actually, a textile mill. And I remember the wonderful trips we used to take. Every summer, we used to go wonderful places. And here, it shows us in \u00c9vian-les-Bains, which was the summer just before the war, we went to France. My-- that's where we met my mother's brother and his new wife, who had come just after they had gotten married. My aunt was an American, a foreigner.

"], ["before the war", "Just as the war started, I remember just before the war started, lively discussions in my grandmother's house. There were some rumors. A lot of friends of my father's and uncle's and family's had suggested that we should leave because things were getting pretty bad in Europe. However, that was not what my father and my uncle thought we should do. They wanted to remain. Because after all, we were very well respected in Belgrade, and there was a feeling that nobody would really touch any of us. However, just before the war, as I said, there were many, many discussions in my grandmother's. And they were also-- there was a feeling in the air that something unusual was happening. There were air raid rehearsals. And I know my little sister was a year and a half younger than I was, was equally upset as I was about the events. We couldn't sleep well anymore with the sirens going full blast. "], ["worries concerning being Jewish", "And-- INTERVIEWER: Was there unrest or a feeling that there was something in the air regarding being Jewish? Especially? SUBJECT: Not really about being Jewish. But just unrest in the air. I remember actually there were parades, people parading in the streets. And marching and saying bolje rat nego pakt, meaning that it was better to go to war than to make a pact with the Germans. "], ["rumors regarding Jews in Germany", "INTERVIEWER: But you didn't know about what was happening to Jews in Germany? Or you never heard that? SUBJECT: Well, I think that my parents probably have heard. Had heard quite a lot about it. However, we're not really believing that that was happening. And also did not believe that that would happen to the rest of Europe, which indeed, it did happen.

And my uncle, who was in the cavalry, was not called to arms. So, however, he decided that he was going to volunteer, because after all, he was going to help out too. And-- INTERVIEWER: This was the Yugoslav army? SUBJECT: This was the Yugoslav army, which my father was an officer. And here is my father in uniform. But that was already later when he was a prisoner of war. "], ["the German invasion", "I don't know exactly how many days the resistance of the Yugoslav army actually lasted. But it wasn't very long. On the 6th of April, when we woke up very early with the Stukas zooming down into Belgrade and bombing everything in sight, it was, of course, an incredible shock for all of us. I remember waking up to that terrible noise and flashing lights, which were really bombs falling down. And I remember someone grabbing me and throwing some clothes on me and shaking, really. I was shaking from fear. "], ["coming back home", "And being grabbed and brought down into the cellar of the house, where we all huddled together and waited for the air raid to be over. And, at some point, my father appeared. And took the family group and brought us to the house next door, to the building next door, which was really much safer. It was a sturdier building. And our nanny went back with my mother and filled a suitcase with some things that she-- that they could find quickly for us to change into. "], ["in the basement", "And we spent a couple of nights-- a couple of days in this other basement, air shelter. Air raid shelter. And that's when my father kept on going, coming and going, for those two days. And finally he came with one of our two cars, and with a chauffeur. "], ["preparing to leave the city", "And with the idea that he was going to take us out of the city to wait till the end of that bombardment. And so we started out by car with that one suitcase filled with the most incredible things, like, I remember my mother telling me later on, there were some very few clothes for us children. And there was even a tablecloth in there, which made absolutely no sense. But that's what people do when they are under pressure. "], ["trying to leave the city", "And we started out with the car. But very soon, we realized that any moving target was going to be bombed by the stukas. So my father decided we would be better off just walking. So we went-- we went out of the city walking.

"], ["understanding the danger of being Jewish", "INTERVIEWER: You didn't feel any special peril being Jewish? Even then? SUBJECT: No, not as yet. However, when we came back, that's when it really all became clear. "], ["coming back to Belgrade", "Because first of all, when we came back to Belgrade, which was by then occupied, my father was already taken prisoner, and brought to Germany. The first thing that, of course, my mother did was to go to the apartment where we lived and to try to, you know, get re-established there. The first thing we found out that no Jew could go back to their apartment. That they were all taken over by the Nazis, by the Army, I suppose, German army. And also we were not allowed to take anything out of those apartments at that point. And, I guess going back down, she noticed that our janitor, the caretaker of the house, who was a member of the fifth column in Yugoslavia, which is a special army made up of people whose-- whose background was German, and who had some feelings for the German movement, he had taken most of us things, most of our personal possessions, and because my mother went down to protest, to complain. And she noticed that all of our things were down there in the closet. So the only apartment that was not taken over was my uncle Ivan's apartment. Because his wife was Turkish. Was a Turkish national. And they still could own their apartment. She was Jewish, but didn't seem to matter in this case. And so, our family went to live with my Aunt Anika. And also my grandmother went there, who found herself in the same situation. And my other two aunts and an uncle. And everybody almost, most of the members of our family went to live in this one apartment. And we lived there for a while. I don't remember exactly how long. But meanwhile, pretty awful things were happening daily in Belgrade. "], ["the Nazi's deeds in Belgrade", "They were-- they were attempts by some of the partisans, some of the underground members, to undermine the Nazis and to drive them away this way. There were bombings and sabotage attempts. And as, almost any the smallest insult to any of the German nationals in Belgrade was returned, was counterattacked by the Nazis with some awful, incredible deeds. And one of them was 500 men-- there was a bombing again of one of the, I don't know what it was exactly. Some place where German I think high command was in Belgrade. And 500 Jewish men-- no first of all, what happened is that the Nazis said that all the Jewish men had to report to this one place. And then they chose 500 men to be hostages until the people who sabotaged this place would turn up. Well, what happened is nobody turned up. So they picked and they put these 500 men in a big square and picked every fifth, and to be held as hostages longer. My uncle, who, my uncle Ivan, who I had mentioned before, who had gone and joined as a volunteer the army, had-- I did not tell you that before-- he had come back very soon because he had been, while crossing a bridge from Belgrade to another little town, he had been shelled by one of the planes, and he lost both of his legs. So he was in the hospital for a while and then he returned to us on his crutches. And that time, my Aunt Anika, who was able to return to Turkey, urged him to go back with their little daughter, to go back to Turkey to her family, and wait the end of the war. However, my uncle, who had had a pact with my father that whoever would stay behind, would survive this, would take care of the rest of the family, said that he would not go without us. And so my aunt left with Lily and my uncle stayed with us. However, when this call came for all the Jewish men to report to this place, my uncle felt very proud to be a Jew. And felt that even though he was wounded, he would go up there. And he did go there. And he was one of the 100 men picked. And they were shot. And almost-- we don't know exactly when. But they were shot. They weren't kept hostages. INTERVIEWER: Were you at the square when t he picking was done? SUBJECT: No. No. I was at home. I remember someone coming and telling my grandmother that the despair and the disbelief. And I remember an aunt, my grandmother's-- actually my father's aunt, grabbing me by the hand and taking me shopping just to get us out of there, I guess. My sister was younger, so maybe she wasn't as involved with this. But. And I remember going to the market, which was opened only a certain few hours to the Jewish people. And I remember coming back with a basket of eggs. Maybe I remember it because my aunt tells me this story often. She is still living. And I guess there was so much horror in the house, in our house where we live now, in that confusion, I stepped in the basket of eggs and ruined that shopping. "], ["trying to escape", "So that's when my uncle and other uncle who was a doctor and he was the head of the ambulatorium, which was sort of like a hospital in Yugoslavia for all the Jewish people. Decided that maybe there was-- we would have to get out and leave towards Italy, somehow make our way to Italy. Of course, I don't remember all of these details. Because we were not made part of this. We were very small children. "], ["yellow tag", "However, I know my mother was wearing that awful yellow tag on her arm. And there were curfews and there were awful daily things that we went through. "], ["pictures", "INTERVIEWER: Do you have any pictures of that? SUBJECT: No I don't. I don't have any pictures of that. I have pictures before the war. INTERVIEWER: I just wondered what your next picture was. SUBJECT: Oh, my next picture is when we went to Italy. However, I could show you a picture of my family when we fled to Italy. This is the uncle I'm talking about. He's Ashkenazi, Dr. Isaac Ashkenazi. INTERVIEWER: Can you-- SUBJECT: OK. And that's his wife, Ella. This is my mother. This is my grandmother, my sister Elisa, and myself. INTERVIEWER: And you-- this was just before you left for Italy? SUBJECT: No. This is when we arrived in Italy. So was maybe a few months after what I'm just telling you now. However, OK? Shall I put it down? However, I remember my dear uncle being offered again to be taken out of the country somehow, smuggled out by an old lady who claimed that she knew him from their time, the time that they both studied in Vienna at the University. And he again, this uncle too said he would not go without the rest of the family. And in this picture, it doesn't show. But they had a daughter Vera, who was a teenager in those days, 10 years older than I was. And my Aunt Lea is not in this picture. "], ["escaping", "However, when we finally fled from Yugoslavia, there were eight of us. INTERVIEWER: How did you travel? How did you-- SUBJECT: Well the first thing that happened is we divided into small groups. My mother and my sister and I formed one group. My uncle, aunt, and their daughter another group, and my Aunt Lea and my grandmother a third group. INTERVIEWER: Did you bring belongings with you? Were you able to bring some of your belongings? Because you look very well dressed in that picture. SUBJECT: Well, Those were the days that we still had what we had, you know, with us. No, we had just about a suitcase or so. Very little. I remember that, just like that, one evening, one afternoon, my mother told us that we were going to leave and that our new names were-- my sister's name was beba, which was very simple, baby. And mine was-- my nickname was seka, which was sister. And she gave us our new names to remember, and that we were going to leave. And we were not to mention our other names. And we were to pretend not to know grandmother and anyone else that we met along the way. So we went to some friends with this one suitcase after the curfew. "], ["family", "My mother threw away her tag that she always wore, her armband. And she made an attempt to convince her mother and to leave. But my other grandmother would not leave because my uncle, which you probably can't see very well. But my other uncle, Leo, had been taken on the workforce by the Germans. And supposedly was going to be brought back-- was going to come back to Yugoslavia. So my grandmother, who is in this picture here in the carriage with my grandfather, decided to stay behind with my Aunt Edith and wait for Uncle Leo to come back. And of course, that was the last we heard of them. My uncle Max, who was my mother's other brother, had gone already to the United States because that's where he and his wife decided to-- "], ["pictures and documents that the family took", "INTERVIEWER: Your mother had these pictures with her, however? SUBJECT: Yes. My mother had this-- these pictures with her. And all during the time that she was faking, that she was well brought up Yugoslav orthodox lady-- orthodox, by that I mean, Christian Orthodox, she was carrying this little prayer book that was my grandmother's. INTERVIEWER: And no one found it on her? That's a Jewish prayer book? SUBJECT: No. That's a Jewish-- we were so fortunate, you can't imagine. We also had letters that my father had sent to us from Germany. And I noticed this one, for example. No, actually, I'm making a mistake. This is the one we sent my father. And he brought them back with him and we made copies. You can't see it very well. But if you could, you could see that this is a stamp, a Yugoslav stamp of the King. And we had a lot of things that we shouldn't have had. Yes. "], ["escaping", "When we escaped through that evening, we escaped from Yugoslavia and-- by train. We left Yugoslavia by train the next morning. We stayed at a friend's house. And we traveled by train through-- eventually, we went to Albania. And from Albania we took a truck. I know there was at some point, we had a cab that we had rented. "], ["money", "We had very little money with us. But the rest of the money supposedly was waiting at the other end. However, the person who was supposed to give it to us never did give it to us. INTERVIEWER: How was your mother managing with paying for transportation and food? SUBJECT: Well my uncle was-- eventually we became a group again. And there was some money that she had with us. But that was it. "], ["getting caught", "And when-- when we finally came to Albania to a certain-- to one of the cities in Albania, which, by the way, was occupied by the Italian army, we were thrown in jail-- into jail because, we were found out. I mean they realized that we were Jewish refugees from Yugoslavia. And they were going to send us back to Yugoslavia. INTERVIEWER: How did they find out? SUBJECT: I don't know. I never really went through the details. Except that I know that there were several other people on that same route. And maybe they became suspicious of people traveling without any possessions really and fleeing in such a hurry. And however, the Italian soldiers, and that officer really-- they were very human. They decided not to send us back. And what they did instead was send us to Dalmatia, which was part of Yugoslavia, but also occupied by the Italian army. And so, again we were imprisoned, put into prison. And had to await a transport which took us into Trieste, where we took a train and went in to Vitorrio Veneto, which was a place in the Veneto, which is the northern part of Italy. And this is the questura. The questura is the police station, and also city hall, of the little, little place. INTERVIEWER: Who had the camera? Who was taking pictures? SUBJECT: Oh, this?

From this, Vittorio Veneto, which was a larger center, there were many other families in similar situation. And we were distributed throughout small cities and villages in northern Italy. And Cison de Valmarino was where we ended up with about five other families. And-- This is another picture of my sister and myself in those days. We-- our family tried to have a very normal life for us, under those circumstances. It was difficult. But, there was even a young man who was a teacher. And my sister and I and two other-- three other children, a little boy and two other girls had school every day in our kitchen. And it was a K-1, because my sister was younger. And we were first grade material already, we were seven-year-old children, three of us. And so we learned-- we learned a lot. INTERVIEWER: You were living where? SUBJECT: We were living in Cison de Valmarino. INTERVIEWER: But somebody found a house for you? SUBJECT: Yes. We lived-- it wasn't a house. It was a room and use of a kitchen. It was this house here. And it was on top of a bar. This-- the owner-- the lady that owned the house owned a bar in this little town. INTERVIEWER: You were not-- you were pretending you were not Jewish? SUBJECT: No, we were now definitely Jewish. Openly Jewish. "], ["protection by the Italian government", "And the interesting thing is that once we were in Italy, we were protected by the government. We were interned into this little villages, assured of a place to live, given coupons for food, tessera and a certain allowance to live on by Mussolini's' government. And that was really amazing when you think of it. "], ["life in Italy", "And my uncle after a while, since this was such a little village, the only industry in the village was filanda which was a silk factory. And they were little silkworms. They were then taking the cocoons and making into silk. And this is what's remained-- what has remained of this. Alongside the filanda there was the river where the women washed the clothes. And I remember that very much. INTERVIEWER: Did your mother work? SUBJECT: My mother did not work. And the only one that eventually was allowed to work, but was not really allowed to work was my uncle, who was a doctor. And he was the only doctor in several villages around. So people were very happy to have him. Practice medicine, and help the local pharmacist. And this was the street behind our house. And, just to show you, have an idea how it looks. This used to once be our garden, and a vegetable garden. And I remember that fondly because part of our curriculum, quote, unquote, in that first grade, I remember that one of my favorite things was the spring and summer season when we used to grow things. And we used to, each one of us, have a little place in this garden. And we used to grow a pea plant, which was so dear to us. INTERVIEWER: You were not fearful of being discovered? Of the Germans coming in? Of anything-- SUBJECT: Well, we were protected by the Italian government at that time. So, at that point, there was no fear. "], ["deciding to leave Italy", "However, at some point, when Mussolini's government fell, even though we had established ourselves in this little town, and we were very well liked, and the count, who lived up in this castle, Conte Brandolini, offered to take us in and to hide us in one of his many places he owned. We decided that just wouldn't be safe for us to remain there. Wouldn't be safe for our friends to have us there. So we just left. We got some more false papers. And testifying that we were Catholic refugees from the Veneto. And we decided-- my uncle decided the best thing to do is to start going south towards the allies that are now pushing north. So, again, with very few resources, because we didn't get that money at the end of that threat that we were supposed to. "], ["leaving Italy", "We just took various means of transportation, starting out with the corriera, which is the bus. And then we took-- we took a ship for a while and a small boat. Went through Venice and down the Adriatic coast. Little by little, we made our way into the Marche, which is a-- well, if I had a map, I would tell you. Ancona would be the capital of the Marche. And we took finally this little train. And stopped at this station. Which doesn't look like a station now. But I wanted to show some of the holes that are American airplanes made at the end, you know, just before they finally liberated that part of Italy. However, we stopped there, at that station. And for whatever reason, I guess mainly was just plain being tired of running, decided to stay there and see whether we could stay, remain, in that little town. And indeed, first the station master came and talked to my family. And when they heard-- my uncle didn't tell them the whole story that he just told them very little. One thing he didn't tell them was that we were Jewish. "], ["staying at the station master's home", "However, they heard enough that-- I remember a lot of tears going from the eyes of Mrs. Bruti, which was the station master's wife. And they just took us up into the home. And she prepared the most wonderful meal we had in a long time. And we-- we stayed there. They put us off for a few days. We slept on mattresses. And my grandmother was given Mrs. Bruti's bedroom. And we stayed there for a few days. And then Mr. Bruti brought the priest of the town. And the doctor in the town to talk to my uncle, and to decide what to do next. "], ["staying in Amandola", "And when they heard most of the story, I think the priest immediately guessed what we were. But he never really said it openly. They decided to find us a place to live, to give us clothing, food, and everything else. And we stayed in Amandola, which was the second place where we lived. The first place where we lived was this little house. It was very, very old and very small. And the center of the little house was a kitchen with a very smoky fireplace. And I remember that about that little place more than anything else. I remember going down those steps and getting the water, which there was no water in the apartment, and no cooking, no stove. My aunt and mother, whoever did the cooking, they did it in the fire place. Anyway, we lived in Amandola for about, I'd say, two years at least. "], ["memories from Amandola", "And we made many, many friends. The people were just incredibly wonderful, warm. With all the horror of not being in touch with my father now, because we couldn't give ourselves away by writing to the last address where he was. So we still managed to, as children, I remember having some wonderful moments, a warm human little episodes. And I became, at that point, we went first, the first half of the year, we tried to learn Italian well enough to go to school. Naturally, we were telling everybody we were refugees-- Italian refugees from the north. So supposedly we were speaking perfect Italian dialect, Venetian dialect. My grandmother got away with that because, in our family, since we are Sephardic Jews, there was Spanish spoken, alongside with Serbian. So that if you know, there was Italian spoken with a Spanish lilt, that sounded enough like Venetian to get away with. However, in very little time, my sister and I forgot all the Yugoslav because there was no word-- not one word spoken in Serbian in Yugoslav in those days. And, in the next school year, we were able to enter the regular third grade for me, and second grade for my sister, and make it in the school. And, I guess this was the soccer field that we use to go to for amusement to watch the soccer games where our friends played and their big brothers. And that was one of my fond memories. "], ["family after liberation", "INTERVIEWER: You had lost contact with your father. When you were finally reunited with him, where were you? SUBJECT: That was after the war. We were in a relocation-- in an UNRRA camp in the south of Italy, near Bari. INTERVIEWER: Why did you go there? SUBJECT: Camp. Because we had decided that we wanted to wait for my father to reappear. And that was the best place to wait. Plus, my uncle had felt that we would not go back to Yugoslavia. We had heard about the communist regime. And that we would not go back there unless we were sure that that's what we wanted to do. So, however, another little thing that happened. "], ["growing up as a catholic", "Well, of course, while I was in Amandola, I was going to church faithfully every day with my friends. This is one of the churches. And I became, quite honestly, a devout Catholic, I suppose. And my fondest wish in those days to undergo the ceremony of first communion. So, the priest, who was-- there were two priests actually that were become very dear friends of ours. And one of them, Don Quinto, that we went to visit last year when we were in Italy-- here's Don Quinto Roscioli. When we were in hiding up in the mountains in his place just before we were liberated, it became necessary for us to go up in the mountains to be safer. He said, look, I'm going to teach you everything there is to know about you know, all the catechism. However, I will not, under these circumstances, baptize you or go through the ceremony that you wish to undergo. But some day in the future, when the war is over, if you should still feel this way, come to me and I'll be the happiest man this earth to do this for you. And indeed, you know, that takes a very special person to say that. "], ["getting help from non-Jewish people", "And all of these friends were just incredible people. They really risked their lives to save us, to hide us. Because the Germans were right in that little town the whole time. And all, you know there was, all anybody had to say was one word. And everybody was going to be killed. In fact, there was one atrocity that was committed. There was at some point, I guess, there were a lot of young men that was-- that were called to join the army, quote, unquote. And there were quite a few of them that just went into the hills and did not show up. This one young man was caught carrying a rusty pistol that obviously wasn't working. However, to make an example of him, the Germans caught him and brought him into the center, into in the piazza, into the square. And they tortured him right in front of the people in the town-- INTERVIEWER: Were you there? SUBJECT: --for quite a while. I was in a building right overlooking the square. I, you know, wanted to look. I didn't dare to look. And I wanted to look. And that went on, and I think, I don't know what of this was what I recollect and what part of this is just what I was told. But this is the plaque that commemorates that killing. Finally, they dunk his head for quite a while in-- in one of those throws, throughs. How do you call them, where animals drank? INTERVIEWER: Troughs. SUBJECT: Yeah. And after they though that he was sufficiently tortured, then they shot him right there in the square. And the people were just beside themselves. But that was just as they were retreating. They were doing all sorts of horrendous things, even in Italy. INTERVIEWER: Your father must have also been protected much as you were. Because if they never found out in a POW camp in Germany that he was Jewish, his fellow soldiers must have been very careful with him. SUBJECT: They were very careful and very supportive and wonderful. They were some people that I guess that he knew from before the war. He was very well respected and loved in Belgrade. And really, it's-- it's incredible when you think that there is-- here's a group of people that were-- that could have maybe gotten an extra loaf of bread. They were that desperate that they would have wanted an extra loaf of bread. But they would not, you know, tell anyone about his background. Or if, I don't know how these things happen. But there is absolutely-- that's one thing that you see, along with the most inhumane and horrendous things that happened in this war, you also saw alongside, the most wonderful and human people that you would ever want to meet. "], ["family after liberation", "INTERVIEWER: When your father rejoined you, he found you in the UNRRA camp? SUBJECT: Yes. INTERVIEWER: What did he tell you? SUBJECT: Well, it was really quite a thing. He appeared, just appeared. He did not know where to begin to look for us. And first of all, he was told that he had to go back to Yugoslavia. That was, you know, that was, I guess, the agreement between the allies and the Yugoslavs and the Russians. The various members of the allied group. So, that he actually decided to flee that place where he was after he was liberated in order to go to Italy and look for us, and not to go to Yugoslavia at that point. So that's what he did. He, I think, bought a car, a second hand car, and a gun. And took off. And when he looked for us in north of Italy, nobody knew where we were. Then he heard that there was a whole group of displaced persons down in the UNRRA camp near Bari. And that's where he, you know, he pushed down south. And he finally went to a place in Bari, in a central office looking for us. And there was my other uncle, his other brother, who had also escaped through to Italy and had finally been rejoined with us. And this other uncle, of course, took him right away to Santa Croce, where we were Cenote di Nardo. And that's-- all of a sudden, I saw my father walking up the steps. Actually, there was a woman that came before him and said, your father is coming. And it was such an emotional moment that my first response at age 12 and 1/2 or whatever I was was, you're lying.

Because I just couldn't stand to be disappointed, I guess. And-- and then I saw my father. An just was incredible. And then we had to break that slowly to my grandmother, who had a heart condition. So, I remember after he stayed with us for a little while, my aunt and my uncle went and told my grandmother that my father-- they just heard my father was alive.

And I think the overwhelming message for me is that we can find a way of helping people in the world. And that you can never repay the same people perhaps of the good they did for you. But you can help other people. You can help the people coming from Viet Nam, and people coming from-- that are undergoing great tragedies in their lives now. I'm going to be fortunate enough to have four Vietnamese children in my program that I'm going to be working in next year, in bilingual nursery school.

So my father lost his business already 1941. Most of the Hungarians, Jewish people, could keep their businesses almost to the very end. There was a reason for that, really.

My brother who was also a little younger than I am but was a big, strong kid, I was told when I went back to Hungary in 1946, because I was searching for my family, I was told that he was healthy.

If they're going to ask me what nationality I am, because were together probably, these French prisoners of war, I will tell them I'm French. My-- my brother stepped out, and they shot him the day before the liberation.

He wasn't deported, because he won the wrestling in the Olympic games. It meant so much to them. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the day that Hitler took power?

And one day, I went in there after-- you must have heard about the der appell When thousands-- at least 15,000 girls had to stand in the heat, five deep, and stand for hours just to count us twice a day. And after the der appell I would go in for treatment. And that one day, the doctor was, what I thought, very mean to me. She said to me, get out of here, but get out fast! I said to myself that she, why is so bad to me? I, more or less, went there because she was a mother figure to me. I felt so good. Also, I asked her to keep me there because I was dying to be in a bed. We had no beds. We were lying on the floor like herrings, thousands and thousands of girls. If one straightened out, for the other, there was no room. And she just shoved me out that day, and she was-- I thought she was mean to me. What was really that Mengele-- you must, I'm sure you know about Mengele-- he was standing there at the doorway. And that day, he wanted 30 people from the ambulance, because those who were very sick, they went first. And they went on the wagon, and they told him that they're going to go to Auschwitz in a hospital. And the doctor, of course, wanted to save my life. And she told me, get out of here quickly. And here Mengele stood on one side of the doorway. How he didn't grab me, I never know. I never know. He could have easily grabbed me, and that would have been the end of me there. INTERVIEWER: He gra-- he was-- he wanted 30 people? SUBJECT 1: 30 people from that particular ambulance. INTERVIEWER: For what? SUBJECT 1: Oh, to the crematorium. INTERVIEWER: Not for medical-- SUBJECT 1: Of course not. And they were-- the poor people were told that they will get better treatment in Auschwitz in a hospital. And they went on a wagon, but the doctor knew where they're going. And she thought that I wasn't sick enough for that yet. So she told me, Eva, get out of here fast. And here I walked out, and he didn't grab me. I was just very, very lucky.

Can you describe that, how-- SUBJECT 2: Yeah, from-- not in Auschwitz, I met him in Warsaw. INTERVIEWER: Start-- can you start from the beginning? SUBJECT 2: Those two young men, I knew them from my hometown, Breslau. And I met him in Warsaw, in the concentration camp Warsaw. INTERVIEWER: Start-- can you say you knew who from Warsaw? Can you start from the beginning of that story? You knew who from Warsaw? SUBJECT 2: Two young men. They came from my hometown. They wanted to go to America on the St. Louis on a boat, St. Louis. And the boat, as you know, didn't no port-- Cuba and America didn't let them in. They brought them back to Europe again. And some of them escaped. They got to permit to land in France or Belgium. But they came back to Germany. And from there, they took them in a concentration camp. Those two young men, they came to Auschwitz, and like me, from Auschwitz to Warsaw. And they told me in Warsaw the same story. And in Warsaw, a typhus epidemic broke out in 1943, the end of 1943. And both of them died there. INTERVIEWER: Did they tell you about the trip on the St. Louis? SUBJECT 2: They actually didn't tell me, though. I had no idea what it was, what it meant. Only after the war when everybody was talking about it, I knew what it meant. They didn't let them in in Cuba and, then America. But it showed that 1,000 people they didn't let, because they were Jews, didn't let them in in this country while, at the present time, hundreds of thousands of other refugees, they let them in here. INTERVIEWER: Did they-- did you-- why did they end up in concentration camps? Some people were-- SUBJECT 2: Unfortunately they brought them back to Germany. The other ones, they could land in-- they had a permit to go to France or in Belgium. Maybe those two, eventually maybe they landed someplace in a concentration camp, because all the Jews in Europe were rounded up, and they took them. But some could went in hiding. But those two, they came back to Germany, and from then, the Gestapo took them right away over and put them in concentration camps.

Weren't you concerned about leaving your family in Breslau when you went to-- SUBJECT 2: My parents, they saw that-- yeah, that's what I wanted to say. The Gestapo was after me. Since my brother fled from Germany, the Gestapo came to my parents' house and they said where's my brother? They said they don't know where he is. They said if he doesn't show up, they're going to take me. So I had no other choice to go and escape to from Germany. I just was lucky that they didn't catch me at the border. Otherwise I wouldn't be here anymore. "], ["currency", "INTERVIEWER: What is that currency that you're holding there? SUBJECT 2: When I was in Poland in a forced labor camp, I made a trick there. There was a German civilian company that used prisoners for working. And one of those-- how can you say-- worker. SUBJECT 1: [INAUDIBLE]. SUBJECT 2: Yeah, no, no.

Anyway, I knew that my parents went to Theresienstadt in 1942. And after the war, I was-- I went to Munich after I was liberated. And I heard people from Theresienstadt went to Munich too, and I was listening around if I find somebody. And I really found a woman. She said, yeah, I know your parents were liberated. But I don't know where they went to from Theresienstadt. So I went on my road, and I went to different towns, cities of Germany. And I came to Frankfurt, and there I met somebody else again. He said, yeah, I know your parents were liberated, and they went to Berlin. And then I started my tour to Berlin. This was in the Russian sector. It wasn't the British. I had to cross the border to the Russian sector to Berlin. And I was arrested by the Russians. "], ["in the Russian prison", "When the Russians, they put me in prison for three days.

And he happened to be that-- INTERVIEWER: I didn't understand the money, though. Can you hold it? SUBJECT 2: Yeah. SUBJECT 1: They used money in that camp. SUBJECT 2: To show the Red Cross who usually made their visits there, and they showed them that they have very good, those Jews in Theresienstadt. It was like a model concentration camp. And they gave them money. They had some stores, and then they could buy things. So those are the money they gave him there. He saved it and he gave it to me after the war.

INTERVIEWER: Where-- this ride that you had to sit with the blanket. SUBJECT 2: Oh, in Warsaw, from-- yeah. After-- yeah, for five days-- INTERVIEWER: Sitting in one place?

SUBJECT 2: It was just fortunately that some survived, and-- INTERVIEWER: No, but did they have utensils? I mean, how could they-- SUBJECT 1: No, we never had utensils. SUBJECT 2: It was just-- they couldn't believe it. When they opened the doors when they brought up to Dachau, they wouldn't believe it what happened, how we could survive there. They opened the doors, and they fell out, among them maybe a dozen dead ones in each wagon there. INTERVIEWER: Only a dozen? SUBJECT 1: That's right. SUBJECT 2: In each wagon, yeah. INTERVIEWER: Only a dozen? I would think-- SUBJECT 2: Some maybe more, but-- INTERVIEWER: --most of them would die. SUBJECT 2: Yeah, we thought too. It was unbearable there. INTERVIEWER: You had no food, no water. SUBJECT 2: They gave us bread, but the bread without water, you couldn't eat it. It was a big loaf of bread, but nobody could eat the bread.

I mean, not internals obviously, but did you have to undergo examinations-- SUBJECT 2: Yeah, they checked before-- as I said, when we went from Auschwitz to Warsaw, they checked us again. We had to strip, and then they checked us if you have anything on you. "], ["being aware of what is happening in Auschwitz", "INTERVIEWER: Were you aware that people were being exterminated? SUBJECT 2: When we were in Auschwitz, I wouldn't believe it was a gas chamber. They told us, if you don't make it, you go in there. You see the chimneys down there? I said yeah, I see the chimney. But you see the smoke coming out there? I said yeah. They burn people there. They gas them, they burn them. I wouldn't believe it until I came to Warsaw, and everybody was talking about it. And then finally, I believed it. This really was unbelievable that they would do those things. INTERVIEWER: What about the odor, the smell? SUBJECT 2: We didn't-- SUBJECT 1: We didn't believe it. We didn't believe it. They kept on telling us, people who were there already for years. They kept on telling us, they are burning people there. We just didn't believe it that human beings would do such a thing. SUBJECT 2: --this possible. SUBJECT 1: I just simply-- I said they told me my mother is in a better place. She doesn't have to work. I couldn't imagine they would kill her just because you are Jewish. I just simply did not believe. That's all there is to it. They couldn't tell me that. "], ["leaving Auschwitz", "So when we were in Auschwitz, they selected 300 girls to this particular work. They looked at our hands. They had their very nimble fingers for that particular work and good eyes. And we couldn't imagine what kind of work we're going to have to do. And we were selected, and suddenly we couldn't go. We were the lucky ones. We're going to leave Auschwitz. Suddenly, typhus broke out, and we couldn't leave for another five weeks. Five-- now it's five weeks. We thought it would last forever. And they had to reselect us, of course, because in the five weeks, most people became so weak that maybe, you know, couldn't go. I was very fortunate that night. It was very dark, because they were bombing around Auschwitz. And so they kept the camp very, very dark at night. So they reselected us with one little flickering light, of course, undressed, completely naked. And they couldn't see my body. If they would have seen it, I never would have gotten into the transport. I was already so weak and so thin. "], ["in a work camp", "And then they took us away to this work camp. And by the time I arrived at this work camp, of course we had a lot of marching to do, and a few days in the train with very little food. And when we arrived at this work camp, the man looked us over. He was a civilian, German. And he picked me out from that group, and he said, why did they send you here? You could never do this work. I was so skinny, he couldn't understand that I would be getting among these girls. And he asked me if I could speak German. And I said I can. And actually that saved my life there. Because he said, I need somebody anybody who can translate to the German to other Hungarian girls. INTERVIEWER: What kind of work? SUBJECT 1: The work was-- it was called glas fertigung. They were blowing the bulbs, electric bulbs for airplanes. And the girls, my sister among them, had to stand on their feet from 5 o'clock in the morning. The men were blowing the bulbs, and they had to cut it down. I can't explain it. You have to-- they blew it from the-- it was very hard to work, stand on your feet. But I couldn't do it. I was very weak. And because I could speak the language, they used me more or less to be a Dolmetscher more or less, to be an interpreter when they couldn't understand the Hungarian girls. Also, an old German man took me under his wings. And I could walk about, because I had that work job, had to clean the place. And so this man brought me food every single day. And I-- and I would, every morsel I would share with my sister. And we went to the bathroom, and we ate it there. And he brought me a sandwich every day. If it wouldn't be for that, I probably wouldn't be alive today. A sandwich and a piece of fruit. But we didn't stay too long in this camp, and I don't know if I have the time to tell this, but out of gratitude to this old German, I went and tore off a piece of cloth from my sister's coat. It was a black coat. And I pulled out the threads. In that camp already we had blankets. I pulled out some threads, and I asked the German man if he would bring me a needle. And from memory, I embroidered him on this black material with white thread Hungarian motifs, a cover for a book, and gave it to him for Christmas. "], ["leaving the work camp", "But we didn't stay too long in this camp, unfortunately. INTERVIEWER: Where did you go? SUBJECT 1: Then-- because I think the Russians must have been very near. We would have been probably liberated in a short time, so they dragged us to another camp. They took us near Hamburg, also a lot of marching and a lot of everything. We got to this camp. "], ["in another camp", "We didn't work there anymore, but we had-- it was a lot of beating going on in that camp. I also forgot to mention that in this other camp, in the other camp, I tore off a piece from my apron, just a piece of material, because it was January, very, very cold, and we were shaven. And I made a kerchief for myself to cover my head, and I was beaten up for that, for doing that. So in this other camp, we didn't work anymore, but the men just found pleasure in it, just to beat people, just to-- everywhere where he could find a girl would just hit left and right. INTERVIEWER: With their hands? SUBJECT 1: With their hands, 25 on the back end. My sister was beaten once by him, because-- because he didn't think that the beds were made right. One day he wanted them flat, other day he wanted-- for no reason. Actually it was no reason. "], ["in Bergen Belsen", "And about six weeks later or so, I think the British must have been very near. They evacuated us from that camp, and they took us to Bergen-Belsen. And that was a horrible camp, indescribable. "], ["the liberation", "I mean, the picture what I have here-- I don't know where we have the picture. It-- we have the picture right here, yes. It says on this picture that, at the time the British came in in 1945, April the 15th, this camp was liberated by the British. INTERVIEWER: Is that you? SUBJECT 1: Yeah, that's me. INTERVIEWER: Can you hold it up? SUBJECT 1: But that picture was taken in 1947. INTERVIEWER: This was two years after liberation. SUBJECT 1: Oh yes. There were 10,000 unburied bodies were found in this camp the day the British came in the camp, and 13,000 people died within two months after the liberation, because they could not be saved anymore in that camp. As we were-- as the British marched in, I could not move anymore. I was up in the fourth bunk with billions of lice, and it was just an indescribably situation. My sister came and said-- really, these were the very words-- Eva, even if you die, you have to see for yourself that we are liberated. But I couldn't make it. I couldn't come down by myself. So two girls were holding me, one girl at each side. And the German soldiers put on the white arm band at that time already, because they gave themselves up. And the Hungarians took over the camp. So we came out, and of course those girls who had still the energy to shout, they started to shout in Hungarian very happily that we are liberated finally. So one Hungarian soldier started to shoot. This was after we were already liberated. And a girl right in front of me dropped dead. INTERVIEWER: Why did he shoot-- SUBJECT 1: Why? Because-- because he heard us that we were so happy, that we are free. INTERVIEWER: A Hungarian-- SUBJECT 1: A Hungarian. Hungarians took care of Bergen-Belson at the time of the liberation, because the Germans had the white arm bands and they gave themselves up. And this particular girl who was shot dead happened to have been a Czechoslovakian girl who lived in hiding in Hungary for years. Then she was deported with the Hungarians. And she was the sister of the block leader, so she had it a little better. She worked in the kitchen. She looked very good. And five minutes after we were liberated, she was killed. And the girl who was holding me got a bullet through her arm, the other one under the eye. I was, luckily, saved. But I had typhus, and soon after that they put me in this so-called hospital. INTERVIEWER: I don't understand why you had Hungarian soldiers in a German-- SUBJECT 1: The Hungarians and the Germans were allies. And I don't know how they arranged that, but the Germans wanted to show, probably, that they are the good ones, and they gave themselves up. And the Hungarians were the ones who watched the camp. And these Hungarian soldiers started to shoot. And minutes later, of course, we had to go back in the barracks, because it was too dangerous to be out. So we never even enjoyed being liberated. Because maybe everybody didn't know about this, but this is documented. Maybe everybody was liberated in Bergen-Belsen doesn't even know about this incident. But we all had to go back to the barracks, and we never felt for a minute we were free. Because back in the barracks, and that was that. I was taking very short-- a short time after that to this so-called hospital. INTERVIEWER: And that was liberation for you. SUBJECT 1: That was liberation. SUBJECT 2: The later days of the war, the Germans took anybody from Ukrainian as guards for the concentration camps. We had Ukrainians, Tatars, the Mongols, and in Nazi uniform, they were guarding us. They had from Netherlands, from Belgium. They all sympathized with the Germans. They had-- they put them in uniforms, and they were guarding us while the soldiers, the soldiers, the German soldiers were on the front. You know, it was already those maybe they couldn't trust, but for guarding the camps, they were good enough. SUBJECT 1: As I was laying there very, very ill in the hospital, this girl was with me in the same room. She would tell me all this. Eva, don't turn around. She's dead. This was going on like every hour of the day. How I made it, I never know. I really never know how I-- I don't know. "], ["the starvation", "Even in Auschwitz, we got just one small piece of bread every day after der appell And if we were lucky, we got a little jam. And that was the portion for the day. So they would give for 10,000 girls the piece of bread. And then they start all over again with the jam. They wanted to put it on the top of the bread. By the time they came around with the jam, usually I had no more bread to-- I ate it immediately, because we were starving to death. So I-- excuse me. Excuse me that I did just that, but that's exactly what I did. I licked up-- that was my ration. And what I wanted to mention is this. That when we really felt that we are very close to liberation, all these German women who took care of us wanted to learn a little English. They wanted to show, probably, that they were good to us and everything. I also wanted to learn a little English. I knew German from school. But English I didn't know anything, not a word. So this girl who took English-- just like I took German, she happened to think English, because she came from that part of Hungary which later became Romania-- I just asked her to teach me how to say I am hungry. That's the first thing I wanted to know how to say, because I was starving to death, and I thought the first Englishman I'm going to eat, I want to tell him I'm hungry. And that's really-- those were the first English words I've learned. "], ["clothing in Auschwitz", "INTERVIEWER: How were you clothed in Auschwitz? SUBJECT 1: How I were clothed? As we arrived, they took away everything, everything. And then you would get a rag. You would really just call it a rag. And for some reason, they thought that we have to go through this bathhouse so often, many times I would come back from the bathhouse completely naked, absolutely no clothes. Because there were so many people arrived at that time when we came that they just simply didn't have enough clothes for everybody. So many times, I just came home without anything on me. One day, as we walked home and went to the front of the camp where the men were, this one prisoner saw me-- Hungarian by the way-- saw me walking naked. And they worked with clothes, with clothes in that camp, sorted clothes or something. INTERVIEWER: You mean you walked around naked? SUBJECT 1: Yes. INTERVIEWER: Did many people? SUBJECT 1: Well, some. I was too weak probably to go and grab. You had to-- you had to really use elbows to shove and push, which I could never do, to get clothes. And I was maybe didn't shove enough, was maybe too weak to rush. So those who didn't couldn't get anything. So I came home completely naked, and this man, he was really waited at the fence for those girls who didn't get any clothes. And he threw me a dress. And he said there's a piece of bread in the pocket. And that bread meant as much as-- if you probably would offer me now $10,000, I don't think it would make me as happy as it-- not that we are rich now, but it really wouldn't as a piece of bread what it meant to me at that time. Two days later, they took that dress away from me. So that's how we were clothed. We were not clothed at all. INTERVIEWER: Were there problems for you with clothing? SUBJECT 2: Clothing? Mostly winter time there. In Poland, it was very-- they have a very cold winter there. They gave us a thin cotton coat and a cotton pant. When you had to work outside, we worked on the railroads that carried the rails. And you know, it was very cold, how you could have worked the-- kept the iron there, lift it up. We were about 50 people on one or two. Everybody was ducking. You know, if you stain yourself with this ration of what they gave you, you die. So you had to work with your brain more than with your foot-- or with your strength. And mostly paper bags, cement bags just protection against cold. So if you have to, on the knees, under the cotton coat, we put paper bags from cement that we-- a lot of them worked with cement. But you know, and put on the feet, they gave us wooden shoes through the snow. The wood-- accumulated on the wood. You couldn't walk. You had to shake it off, until the sole came off. So you had to walk almost barefoot in the snow. So we put rags around, paper around, and that makes insulation there. SUBJECT 1: And my sister-- SUBJECT 2: So you have to use all kinds of tricks to survive. SUBJECT 1: Somehow, I don't know how, my sister wore an alligator shoe in Auschwitz. She arrived from Hungary in her alligator shoes, and they didn't take her shoes away. She had to give it up very soon, because she couldn't walk in it in Auschwitz. With the little heel, you couldn't. She had to exchange it for a wooden shoe.

He spoke maybe nine languages. So he was preferred in the-- he worked in the laundry. In the laundry, in the wagon, there was soldier and the guard, he went outside the ghetto. And there, he met a Polish girl. And they made an arrangement that he wants to escape one day, and he even spoke to the guard to escape too. But when it came to it, he backed out, the guard. So he had no other choice. He knocked him down by the rear in the ghetto, outside to ghetto already. But another guard on the tower, he saw this incident, and he shot him. So they brought him in the infirmary in the camp for three months. But in the meantime, the report went to Berlin. And one day, on Sunday, we never had a der appell It means when they count you. We never had one on Sunday. And the day before, they erected the big, like a telephone pole in the middle of the camp. So on this particular Sunday, they had a der appell We had to stand around there, and they brought him tied. The hands were behind, tied behind the back. And they hung him in front of us. And their own brother had to watch it, so of course he fainted and unconscious. But I wonder brutal how is-- brutal they were, these-- SUBJECT 1: If you would allow me, maybe-- SUBJECT 2: --Germans. "], ["the Allies did not try to save the Jews", "SUBJECT 1: Could I say something about it? My feelings about it, are these-- I feel that our deportation could have been prevented. Is it-- would you allow me to talk about that? You see, because it was so late in the day, in 1944, when they deported the Hungarian Jews. Please don't misunderstand me. I don't for one minute think that we are more important than the German Jews or the Polish Jews or any of them. But in those days when they took my husband, and they took the German Jews, there are nothing the Allies could have done, because the Germans were ahead. At the time they took the Hungarians, the Allies were winning everywhere. I don't know if I brought along that magazine or not. I'm reading this magazine that the Americans were stationed in southern Italy. And they went along on the same track line where we went from my city to Auschwitz. A few miles away from Auschwitz, they were bombing some oil refineries just about three miles away from Auschwitz. We even saw those planes. We heard them, and we saw them. And we were begging that they should just come, and we didn't care if we die. We didn't care anything. But we could never understand it. And what I'm reading now, after the war, of course, that two men escaped from Auschwitz in 1944, April, April 10th. And that was almost unheard of, because only a few people managed to escape from Auschwitz. They brought the whole blueprint of the camp exactly were the crematorium is located. Exac-- exactly where the crematoriums are located and everything. And they sent it to all the governments. So there was no question about it, that they couldn't have at least bombed the crematoriums.

INTERVIEWER: Nothing changed in your life during the war years? Life was still good? AGNES: The war years, after anti-Semitism, was exist naturally. "], ["antisemitism before the german occupation", "INTERVIEWER: When did that begin? AGNES: The anti-Semitism uh, uh, was spreaded naturally when-- when Hitler became to power and spread it around us everywhere. It started with the Anschluss, when Austria was occupied by-- by Hitler. INTERVIEWER: And what happened to you in terms of anti-Jewish experience at that point? AGNES: Uh, when we used to go to school-- high school-- we used to go to public school, all of us. Uh, the lifestyle was different a little bit in Hungary, like in Poland or in Russia, because Poland and Russia and Lithuania, most of the Jewish people were put behind ghetto bars, and they didn't have the chance to assimilate. The assimilation was very great in Hungary. It was-- it was a little different lifestyle. But when I used to go to high school, we felt the anti-Semitic wave, uh, hit us, uh, in our way. Uh, it's very hard to explain, but, uh, we used to had A and B class. Anybody who-- who are Jewish weren't allowed to go to the B class. Uh, and those gentile children, whom rather, uh, not, uh, th-- they didn't have enough s-- place to be in the ble-- B class. They-- they were used to go with us. So we weren't actually completely separated by the gentiles. We used to go together with gentile children, but we were separated in a term of certain class. You understand what I-- INTERVIEWER: Yes.

Anyways, uh, I am personally, and my family wasn't, uh, touched very, uh, uh, uh, deeply for anti-- anti-Semitism because we knew, uh, uh, it is exist, the anti-Semitism, but my father was still in business, uh, nobody took the-- the license away from him. But in the middle of the war, uh, they didn't let a Jewish student enter to the university anymore. So many of them, if they had the opportunity, uh, moved to Italy. And it was the most interesting part of it Mussolini, the fascistic Mussolini, accepted that the Jew student from the Hungarian universities to transfer there, or whom wanted to enter from high school to university. That was one thing. And another thing, uh, many people who graduated from law school or from, uh, uh, medical school, they didn't have the permit, uh, to practice law or-- or-- or, uh, being a doctor. Um, and it-- it was amazing how flexible our Jewish people in Hungary were. Many of the doctors and lawyers became a tailor, or a-- a electrician, or whatever. Uh, that's the way we felt the anti-Semitism. Another thing, my mother was born in Czechoslovakia. And the Czechoslovakian Nazi occupation took place 1942. So basically, we were touched because my family from my mother's side was deported in 1942 already. They just disappeared. And we knew that something bad happened with them. Uh, but it was still a shock to us, 1944, when the Nazis occupied Hungary. Because we thought, we are almost the end of the war, we are going to avoid this kind of a possibility somehow, and we will-- we going to be survive. "], ["the German occupation", "INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the first time that you re-- realized the Nazis were there? AGNES: Yes. INTERVIEWER: What was-- AGNES: It was 19th of March when they came here in 1944, and, uh, my father-- actually, my family from my father's side were born in Hungary generation after generation. So like I said before, the Hungarian-Jewish people were very much assimilated, and we didn't wanted to accept the fact we going to have the same experience that the rest of the Jewish people got before us. But unfortunately, the same thing happened to us. INTERVIEWER: What did you see? When the Nazis watched-- walked in on March 19, what did you-- AGNES: It was a Sunday. I saw a lot of airplanes. I saw-- I saw the German army marching in. INTERVIEWER: Were you afraid as a Jew? AGNES: Of course. INTERVIEWER: What did you do? What did your family do? AGNES: We didn't have too much to do. "], ["ghetto", "Within 24 hours, we got the word that my father wasn't allowed to open his store. Uh, we had to, uh, look for a place for ourselves because we weren't allowed to stay in our apartment. They put the Star of David in certain buildings, which was a-- a temporary ghetto. And they put everyone in the temporary ghetto. "], ["sending the men to labor camp", "But the manpower were taken away pretty soon after the occupation. INTERVIEWER: You didn't know of any men that were taken away prior to the occupation, Jewish men working in work camps? AGNES: Or before where they established labor camp in Ukraine in the 1940s, and young men was brought to Ukraine, and many of them were killed. Most of them actually. INTERVIEWER: Did you know any young men who were forced to leave Hungary? AGNES: Forced to leave Hungary during the war time? INTERVIEWER: Then go to Ukraine. AGNES: My husband, he was among of those people. But, uh, uh, he escaped before they had the opportunity to kill him. Because during the night with his friend, he went outside from a-- from a place where they were sleeping and from a building. And, uh, he was listening the Hungarian soldiers, uh, when they were talking to each other, and they said, as long as there's one Jew alive, we are not going back home to Hungary. So they knew they are not having too much to lose anymore. INTERVIEWER: Did you know him then? AGNES: I knew my husband before, but I didn't know where he is, and he didn't know where I am. INTERVIEWER: You knew he was taken away? AGNES: I didn't know at that time. I just knew that later, after the liberation. "], ["separating the family", "INTERVIEWER: Getting back to your experience-- the Germans came in, what happened to you and your family? AGNES: My father had to-- my heart-- my father was taken-- they took my father away. INTERVIEWER: Where? AGNES: And, uh, naturally our family was divided. Uh, my-- my brother-- my brother was, uh, sent to, uh, Red Cross building which took in young children. Later, I realized the fact Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, uh, paid to the Red Cross a large amount of money to save those young children. That day, we didn't know when my brother was put in that building. "], ["a labor camp", "Uh, I was taken to a Hungarian concentration camp. I was carrying over 120 pound on my shoulder, backs, from early in the morning till late of the night. We-- INTERVIEWER: How did you get to this place, and can you describe it? AGNES: Yes. Uh, I knew one thing in Czechoslovakia. I remember-- that much I knew-- they separated the men, women, and children from each other before the deportation. And I knew they are going to take away the young women also, after the men. And, uh, uh, I was afraid they going to deportate me. So voluntarily, I went to a-- a-- a-- a labor camp, which was fairly good. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the name? AGNES: Yes. But it's a Hungarian name. They called it [? [ HUNGARIAN]. ?] I don't know how-- what is the, uh, uh, right, uh, uh, translation, you know? INTERVIEWER: Was it near Budapest? AGNES: It was in Budapest. And they transferred me from there to a concentration camp. "], ["a concentration camp", "They-- they picked up I don't know how many young girls. I was in the age of 19 that time. And, uh, I don't know it was just plain-- plain luck who-- who can avoid that. But I-- I was a very unfortunate person. They-- they picked me also, and they put me in a mill-- mill, you know, where they make the flour? And I had to carry flour bags on my shoulder. It was a terrible experience. INTERVIEWER: Where was this? AGNES: That was also in Budapest. It was surrounded with a high, uh, brick fence. We weren't allowed to leave the-- the place-- the building. And if somebody tried to give us secretly food from outside, then we were punished who received the food. They did throw us in the basement between the rats for 24 hours. During the night we had to stay there too. INTERVIEWER: Did that happen to you? AGNES: It didn't happen to me because they didn't caught me, luckily. But it happened with many of my friends. INTERVIEWER: This labor camp that they took you to, how were you rounded up? Where was your family-- the rest of your family-- did you know? "], ["family", "AGNES: My mother was put in that building what I previously mentioned. And, uh, my aunt was with her too. And, uh, like I said, my father was in a concentration camp-- a labor camp already. They took all the manpower away, so we didn't know where he is. We didn't know where about, you know, or how we can find him. Uh, they were organize this thing very well. They-- they-- they-- were masterminded. The recipe was the same all over-- all over in Europe. First they took away the mens. Then they-- they-- they put the young, uh, uh, girls and women in a concentration camp. They took away the children from women. I experienced that too. I mean, I didn't have it, not personally. I didn't have children because I wasn't married that time. But I experienced in a term to see that horrible scene. And they took away the children from the mother. And we don't know what happened with them. Some of the children were killed in the same promenade. But the rest of them, I don't know. INTERVIEWER: What did you see? Where did you see this? AGNES: Uh, before-- before-- you know, I escaped a few times. I'm jumping from-- from one conclusion to the other. "], ["the German occupation", "When the German occupied Hungary, that was during the springtime, March. And the time was very-- first to us in Budapest. In the villages, they took everybody. They deportated everyone during the summer. But Autumn-time, they got the Sz\u00e1lasi-- the Arrow Cross putsch-- took-- takeover. And that time, they-- they get wild. They knew they are losing the war. And they were frustrated. And, uh, we are victimized, the-- those Jewish people who remained to stay alive in Budapest, they were tortured, and anybody whom they can caught, uh, they-- they shot to death the Jewish people. Women-- many of them who were hided somewhere and they caughted them. Uh, some of the Swedish protect that house too that they were hided by Wallenberg, Raoul Wallenberg. "], ["separating families", "INTERVIEWER: I want to talk about Wallenberg a little later. But first, I want to ask you. You said you saw a scene where children were wrested away from their parents. AGNES: Yes. INTERVIEWER: What did you see and where? AGNES: They said-- the-- the Nazis-- Hungarian Nazis were screaming left and right. They said, women, uh, I don't care how much is my heart is broken-- I try-- try to translate it to English, the Hungarian words. Put your children down over here. And so no-- no one wanted to-- to leave their children behind. Then they grabbed their children. And the children were-- were crying. I don't want to talk too much about this experience because it's breaking my heart. I can't-- I can't-- I ca-- then I-- then I cannot talk-- INTERVIEWER: Can you just tell-- AGNES: --too much about the rest. INTERVIEWER: Can you just tell us how it sounded in Hungarian, the order to put your children down. AGNES: How it sounded, the order? INTERVIEWER: In Hungarian, what-- how did it sound? AGNES: I should say the-- the Hungarian words? INTERVIEWER: Yes, how they said it. AGNES: Hungarian? Asszonyok adj\u00e1k le a gyerekeiket, ak\u00e1rhogy is f\u00e1j a sziv\u00fcnk, azonnal adj\u00e1k le a gyerekeket. That's the way it sounded. If anybody understand Hungarian, they know what I was saying before. It's terrible. It was a terrible experience. Let's talk about something else. "], ["trying to escape", "When they-- when they took the children away, they brought us to a building, which located in a certain area-- should I mention the name? Teleki t\u00e9r. A few building were occupied by the Nazis, emptied for the purpose of to put young women and girls to that particular building and [CLEARING THROAT] they deportated everyone from there. Uh, when I arrived, uh, I was with my mother. That was, I thought, the end of the line. I tried to escaped from the line. I pushed my mother out first. And I was carrying a heavy bag with the leftover thing what I owned and I wanted to throw away before I escaped from the line because I was figure if I'm going to uh, uh carry the bag, it's very much noticeable that I am escaping. The Hungarian police in Budapest, in our side. they were good, except they were scared from the Nazis. Why they were in our side, I explain that too. Because after the Nazi-- Hungarian Nazi putsch, the Sz\u00e1lasi regime, they took away their gun, and no one liked it when somebody take away the power from them. So they said, uh, they are in our side, but not openly-- not-- not face to face. But we knew, you know, what's going on. So when they-- they-- uh, when we were in line to go to that particular place what I mentioned before-- a long, long line, thousands and thousands of women were there-- we realize that we don't have any other alternative. And what we are risking anyways? They are going to deportate us anyways from that building. We knew this is the last stop, last line. So I ask the police-- because we were surrounded by Hungarian Nazis and policemens-- I ask one of the policemen to talk to the Nazis in the front so I can escape behind their back. And he did that to me. And I escaped from the line. I started to run. I had a place, a street, where I made a date with my mother, where I'm going to-- to meet her, around the [INAUDIBLE] place. So we-- eh, uh, I escaped. And unfortunately, the people in the street, they saw my escape, and they went, uh, calling the Nazis. They said look at the Jewish tramp-- they called us that name-- running there. And I was-- I was blind, and I didn't hear anything because I just so want go to see my mother and meet her. And I didn't-- I didn't hear anything. When I heard them screaming and-- and I realized the fact they are after me, it was too late. "], ["getting caught", "So we were caught by them. But, uh, I forget to mention that before we were put in the line, they said, anybody who escape will be killed by them. So we did-- like I said before, we didn't have any-- any-- any other alternative anyway. So what-- what-- what did we lose? I was figure, I'm going to escape anyways, which I did. And they didn't kill us. Why, I cannot explain. Because that was our destiny to live. We got a few, uh, uh, bump in our head because we were hit left and right by them. But they didn't kill us. "], ["squeezed in a building", "They brought us in that particular building where 5,000 of us were squeezed together-- in a building that is just the place for a few hundred-- a hundred people, we were 5,000. It was during the evening when I realized that it's better if we are going to the, uh, top floor. I don't remember it was a fifth floor or sixth floor, whatever it was. And my mother said to me, why do you want to go there? I said, uh, I-- INTERVIEWER: You found your mother? AGNES: I was with my mother. I find my mother in that street. They caught both of us there. Uh, and, uh, I said to my mother, why I want to go to the top floor, I have a feeling they are going to empty the first floor or second floor. So she said to me, I'm not normal because what give me the idea why they can-- they can empty the floor and put them in the cattle car in the top floor, not in the first floor. I said, you just listen to my instinct. Let's go to the top floor. And we're there in our apartment, squeezed in, a small apartment. Uh, we didn't find a place, even to stand. In a standing position, it was hard to breathe there. It was wintertime. They were scared to open the window because it was a very harsh, cold winter. And actually they didn't heated the place for us. But it was anyways too warm there, because it's too many people were there, and they used up the oxygen. My mother-- somebody get up from one chair and walked out. And my mother took that place and sat down. And, uh, I walked out from that apartment, I looked down, and I heard during the night women are screaming. They were beating them. "], ["examinations", "They took off their clothes, and they were chased to the cattle car with their underwear, during the winter, harsh winter night. They were beating them because they still believed that the Jew are hiding money. I don't know what gave them the idea. And those days, we used to wear dress with shoulder pad in it. So they took off the-- the clothes to looking for the shoulder pad, if it's got money hidden there. And, uh, naturally, they didn't find the money, so they were more frustrated. So those-- those-- those young women had-- had more beating. "], ["deportation of other women", "And I saw them, uh, and I saw the whole-- the whole scene the-- still front-- the front of my eyes. Uh, there were I don't know how many hundred, and hundreds, and hundreds. In that particular building, it was more exist like one building like that, were put in the cattle car-- they were all put in the cattle car in that particular night. Uh, then I was very tired already. I walked back to that room where my mother was sitting, and, uh, uh, I find a little crib. It sounds ridiculous. It was nothing in the crib but the steel, uh, base. It wasn't any mattress, anything in it. But I was so tired, and I was young, and I was wearing a suit, a black suit with a blouse. So I took off my jacket, and that-- I put that down under my head. And I said, whatever it will happen, I still have to rest a little bit, because I can think with a-- with-- with a clear mind after if I'm resting enough. So I lay down, and I fell asleep. During the night, The Hungarian Nazi women came up in those rooms, and with a flashlight they-- they turned the flashlight toward to my face, and they woke me up. They kicked me around, and they left the place. In the morning, when we woke up, the deportation was continuously going on, because they brought more people in. The-- the empty space-- the place in the first few floors were filled up again with victims. In that place where we were, we-- we-- we met friends. And now I should come to Wallenberg. "], ["NO_TOPIC", "INTERVIEWER: We're going to take a break. Before you go to Wallenberg, I'd like you to-- if you will excuse us. Stop taping, please. CREW: [INAUDIBLE] I'm ready when you are, Karen. INTERVIEWER: Are you rolling? CREW: No, not yet. We're not ready yet. Just about. [ INAUDIBLE] INTERVIEWER: OK. "], ["death march", "AGNES: Uh, also, many people were, uh, brought to a big, uh, factory, uh, for the reason to stand them on their feet to a death march to Vienna from Budapest. Why they brought those people to the big factory, uh, with the purpose to walk, because they wanted to use many of the cattle car for their own purposes. So they wouldn't care one way or the other if the Jew dying in a way, uh, uh, to the last destination or are they going to die there. So they had to walk. INTERVIEWER: How far is it from Budapest? AGNES: Budapest to Vien-- Vienna, around, uh, over 200 kilometer. INTERVIEWER: Your uncle? AGNES: My uncle, my father brother, was also among of the marchers. And, uh, he got trouble with his heart, and he couldn't walk. So they shot him to death. INTERVIEWER: How do you know? AGNES: Someone who survived that death march came back and told us the story. My father, by the way, was deportated, and he had to-- he was deportated in the 20th of November with thousands and thousands of other men. And he-- he was deportated to Angara. Uh, and he had to dig his own grave-- 480 of them were shot to death there. 120 is in one grave. After deliberation, I find those mass graves. Because someone who also survived-- just a handful of them survived-- came back and-- and, uh, uh, told us where I can find the grave-- told to my mother and to me. Uh, I'm jumping from one conclusion to the other because I'm-- I'm-- I'm talking about the end. "], ["Raoul Wallenberg", "We-- we-- I was talking about deliberation, and we didn't get to the point yet. Uh, when we were in that, uh, that particular building what I mentioned previously, uh, and 5,000 people-- women-- were, uh, put constantly-- when they emptied the floor, they filled up the floors again, like I said it before. The following day, we got a miracle. Our messiah came. His name is Raoul Wallenberg, who is a Swedish diplomat, and he was sent to Budapest for the purpose of s-- to save the people-- Jewish people in Budapest. INTERVIEWER: I don't understand. The Swedish government sent somebody to save people, or he just did this? AGNES: He asked actually to be sent there, and they did send him. And with his own money, and also with American money, because he used to be a student in the United States, he bought buildings and also paid the Red Cross to-- to hide children in the Red Cross building. And he bought many, many of the building. They called the street name T\u00e1tra utca in Budapest. Where the buildings were used for the purpose to put in people whom he saved. Also, uh, he went with trucks. With the trucks he drove, uh, toward to the Austrian border to try to bring back people who were in a death march. And successfully, he saved a few hundred. INTERVIEWER: Did you meet him? Did you see him? AGNES: Yes. Like I said before, we have 5,000 in the building, and 38 of us were saved by Wallenberg. I was saved, and my mother was saved. That was a miraculous thing. He came in with his-- his aide. I don't know who he was. And he, uh, he came with a book with names. Uh, he wanted to save people whom are having a Swedish passport that he previously furnished-- gave-- gave-- gave away for people. We didn't have the Swedish passport or protective paper. And my mother was begging him, and I begged him to save us. And somehow, he pushed my mother into another room. It was more-- more story to it, but I don't want to stretch my story. INTERVIEWER: No. Tell us. How-- AGNES: You want to heard the whole st-- INTERVIEWER: Exactly what you saw. AGNES: We went-- we-- we were in that, uh, uh, building. We were in one room. And, uh, they called names. The Hungarian Nazis were with him, and they called names. But the Nazis left him for a few minutes. I don't know that was that. He was giving the mummy-- money. They were bribed by Wallenberg or something else was involved. I don't know. But that few minutes were giving us enough time to memorize the name which was written on that book. Because none of them who were saved from that building had the Swedish passport. But he was giving us names. And I don't know. It-- with a miraculous way, we remembered the name. And he pushed my mother into the other room that people were selected already, uh, to-- to-- uh, uh, get out-- bring out from the building, you know. For life, they were selected out of it. The rest of them had the death sentence. INTERVIEWER: Describe him, as he walked in, as he-- AGNES: He walked in a young man, a young handsome man in age of 30s. Yeah, it's tall-- it's not-- eh, it wasn't a huge somebody, but tall. How I can memorize him because I saw him only once, but, uh, his-- he-- he-- his hair was, uh, uh, br-- dark brown, if I remember well. I don't remember his eyes color exactly. I-- I don't remember. He had a long face, uh. He was a very handsome fellow. But, uh, most of all, he had a-- he had a gorgeous, beautiful heart. Because single-handed, he saved directly or indirectly 15,000 Jewish life in Budapest. Among of the 15,000, I am, and my mother was the survivors. INTERVIEWER: When he walked into the room, what did he say? What did you hear him say? AGNES: Anybody who is having Swedish, uh, uh, document. If they don't have it with them in the end, because he went through so many, uh, stages, so nobody could have saved papers. But anyone whose name is in that book, uh, we tried to save them. But he had to announce that that way because the Nazis were sitting on his neck. They were with him. But after, he saved basically I-- he saved me, and my mother, and many other people who didn't have the Swedish, uh, passport or document. And is-- and it was a miraculous way how I survived. I was in one room, and the Nazis said they are going to account every individual person in the other room whom are allowed to leave the building. And 38 of them were accounted. And I didn't know what to do. My mother was pushed in among of that crowd, and I didn't want her to jeopardize the safety of the other people, the rest of them. So I didn't know. I was hesitant to-- to-- to-- to-- to, uh, uh, somehow push myself through and jump in if I can. Or if I-- if-- what should I do? I was hesitant. I was praying. And somehow, I don't know how, I find myself among of the crowd. This is not a makeup story. I was pushed in somehow. I don't know. "], ["faith in God", "I-- I-- I have much deeper faith toward to God. Some people, you know, we were all divided. Some became atheist, the other one have deep-- deeper faith. Why I have such a deep faith? Because I saw the miracle, and I experienced, not only once, but this was a particular event, you know, at-- at-- at that particular time. When they accounted the people of 38, and when-- this-- the Nazis said, if it's one or two more people will be in the crowd outside in the street, they are not-- not allowed, the 38, to survive either. So that's why I was so hesitant. And when we were out of the building, the Nazis accounted to the people two times. And they accounted 38 again. And I was the 39th person. "], ["in Wallenberg's Swedish home", "Then Wallenberg, with his good heart, he brought us personally with policemen escort to a Swedish home-- house-- building that he bought. The building was occupied with many, many people. And he wanted to save practically everyone single-handed. He jeopardized his own life, his own safety. INTERVIEWER: So what happened to you? You went to this house and what-- AGNES: We went to that house, and we were staying there overnight. And, uh, the following morning, uh, Jewish people who were standing guard outside said the Nazis are coming, the Hungarian Nazi party members, and they're going to check everybody's paper. And because we didn't have paper in our hand, they suggested to us, anyone who did-- didn't have the paper, we should run. "], ["running from the Swedish home", "So we were running out from the building, not to know where we going to eat, where we going to sleep, what we going to do during the daytime because we didn't have any identification paper. And it was written on our face, the fear. Because anybody who were caught, they were deportated or they were immediately shot to dead. Then we were remember, we had some, uh, friend in the, s-- uh, uh, Swiss consulate. And we tried to get in. We walked there with my mother. And they let us go in, but during the day time only. And they said during the evening, we have to leave the building. So we were there during the daytime. Evening came early the-- that time because it was winter. 4 o'clock in the afternoon, we were again out in the street, not to know where we going to sleep. And I had the uncle there from Czechoslovakia, who escaped from Czechoslovakia, and he got false document. And he was living in a particular place. He rented a-- a room. And, uh, every morning he had to leave the house, pretend he goes to work. So actually his life was jeopardized too, uh, as a younger man. And we-- we know we cannot find him during the day. So we had a few cents or fill\u00e9rs they call European terms, you know, Hungarian terms-- the money, the-- the currency was fill\u00e9rs We-- we went to the movie. That I suggested to my mother to go to the movie because it's lot of Nazis in the movie, and they are not going to see-- uh, uh, looking for a Jew in the movie. Who have the-- the-- the idea? Who-- who thinks something like that? So it looked like that God was giving me the idea. This was another miracle. And we-- we-- we are sitting in the movie and watching the-- the Hitler documentary, beauty propaganda, uh, f-- films. And in the meantime, I-- my mind was working hard. Where are we going to survive? How are we-- how are we-- how are we going to sleep? Where are we going to sleep during the night? What are we going to eat? What are we going to do? After the movie-- the-- the-- the film was over, it was evening time. And-- and my uncle was standing the front of the building, because he was following us without our knowledge. And he knew where we were, but he didn't want yet to go into the movie. He was waiting for us. And he said, my aunt and my cousin is in a house, which having the Star of David on, and everybody was, uh, tooken away from that building. Everybody was deportated, so the janitor let them go in. So we should go into the building and we have a place where to sleep during the night. We went into that building, and we slept there in that particular night. We met my aunt and my cousin. And my uncle put together some food. So we survived in that night too. In the morning, somebody let the Hungarian Nazis where we are, let them know, and they picked us up again, and they brought us back where we were before. But anyways, indirectly, while I'm back, took us out a day before from that building-- uh, two days before-- uh, no-- a day-- two days before, right. So, uh, that was our luck. Because those days gaining time was everything. Gain time because we knew the Germans are running. And it was the end of the year of, uh, 1944, December, and they were running. "], ["ghetto", "So when they-- they brought us back to that building where we were before, they couldn't deportated us anymore, because the Russians surrounded Budapest completely. And they, uh, uh, picked us up and they threw us to the ghetto. They had a ghetto, which was surrounded with a wall, which we didn't know. The old people were there-- not too many young, because the youngs were all deportated. "], ["working as a nurse in the ghetto", "There, I was a voluntary nurse in the ghetto. Uh, I didn't have any-- any, uh, training as a nurse. But what kind of a training we were needed over there when people were dying like files. Anybody who was surviving there, older-- I called old people because I was 19 years old those days. And the old for me was about the 40s and the 50s. And anyone who were there, in my eyes, they were very old because they-- they had grew gray already, you know, and their face looked old. Everybody aged. And what can I do? I was figure I can do one thing, to watch them, because many of them had severe sickness, because we didn't have anything to eat. And only anyone who very young was able to do something and help them. "], ["before liberation", "The 18th of January, the Nazis put mined under the ghetto. No, uh,uh, excuse me 17th of January. And they said the 19th of January, the-- the, uh, ghetto will be exploded. They're going to kill us all. And, uh, 18th of January, we were survived. The-- the Russians marched in. Maybe I-- I-- I-- I mixed up the date. Maybe a few days before there were there to-- to mined the ghetto. Yeah, a week before, or two weeks before-- I don't know exactly. I'm a little bit confused with the date. But anyways, the police came in, and they let us know what they are doing over there. Because we saw the movement and all the Nazis, what they did there. The ghetto was mined. And because the Russians came in in the 18th-- not because they were so great, the Russians, you know, after we had to hide from them too-- but that particular time, they brought us the life anyways.

Oh, you asked me if I went back home, my apartment. My apartment tooken from a-- a-- Hungarian Nazi. They took-- they took our apartment. They occupied our ah-- apartment. And, uh, we had some far relative, who, uh, had the connection to-- to let us have a apartment-- a Nazi apartment-- Hungarian Nazi who escaped from Hungary with the-- with the Germans, and we got that apartment.

I didn't realize the fact, and I didn't want to realize that, he were not going to survive. He was deportated only six weeks before the liberation, the 28th of November. And we were still waiting for him. And, uh, that's why we were remained to stay there that long, because we-- we escaped finally in 1949. "], ["getting married", "I was married January '46. And, uh, November-- January, November-- January '46, I was married, and November 1946, my son was born. And uh, my first son, firstborn. And, uh, we were waiting too long. We were-- we thought we are not going to have communism. "], ["under the Russians", "The Russians were very, very tricky. They let us believe they are not established a communist government. It was a government there-- there in 1948-- which was, uh, uh, which was a government who let us build ourself up to a normal level financially and physically, and then when we thought we will be all right, then we realized that we were very wrong, because we had a communist putsch, a communist takeover 1948.

AGNES: And we went 19-- 1949, we left Hungary. Uh, we escaped toward to the Czechoslovakian border, and through Bratislava, with the [INAUDIBLE], which was a-- a-- a Jewish underground that was helping us unofficially to go through the Austrian border and gain our freedom to-- to emigrate to Canada. I lived for six years with my husband, with my mother, and with my firstborn ch-- child in Canada. And from Canada in 1956, we emigrated to the United States.

What-- what is your attitude, your-- how has it affected your life, your-- AGNES: It's affected my life spiritually, physically, mentally. Because I don't have one day, one hour of the day-- [CRYING] excuse me, when I don't remember it was hard. They-- I didn't talk about Christmas Eve, when they tied together women and children in Budapest, and they shot them to the river. In springtime, when the ice was melted, the body's were strewn out, and the river was red from Jews' blood. Physically, I was hurt too. Because when I was-- I was in that hard labor camp, concentration camp-- because that was a Hungarian concentration camp too-- they damaged me, that horrible, heavy labor, my whole spine, I get two spinal fusion surgery. And recently, they removed one of my kidney. I had a malignant tumor in my left kidney. Every-- everything happened in my left side, because I was carrying on my left shoulder all those heavy things. INTERVIEWER: Spiritually? AGNES: Spiritually, how can you forget this thing? Seems like everything happened just today. [ CRYING] Should I go on? "], ["crying about old events", "INTERVIEWER: I'd like to ask you one last question. I'm sorry. AGNES: Yes. INTERVIEWER: I don't want to upset you. Some people who are critics of remembering the Holocaust say they don't understand how people can cry about something that happened to them 35, 40 years ago. I'd like you to answer that question if you will. AGNES: I think-- I cannot blame people if they ask that question. You know why? How can I expect from people to understand all this horror till they don't feel it on their own skin? And we pray to God these things should never happen again. Nowhere in the world, so they never, never should experience something like that. But this member is still bright in our heart and in our mind, so naturally we are crying. The-- these past 35 years, it's nothing, the life-- lifetime actually, maybe just about a life and desert-- 35 years flew away so fast, and the memory remained to stay bright in everybody's heart and everybody's mind. Sh-- naturally we are crying. Many people ask me other questions too. "], ["how the Jews did not resist", "How come you didn't resisted to the Nazis. Number one, I try to explain something. If they took the manpower away, and we didn't have any weapon, and we didn't have underground in Hungary, how could we resist? That's one thing. Another thing-- try to visualize yourself staying in one building and they chase you everywhere, wherever you go-- the enemies, they are chasing you, and holding guns against you, and you are without a weapon. How can you resist? I have to say one thing. They used to call the Jew a coward. That's not true, because they killed millions and millions Jewish people. In the front of my eyes, they killed Jewish people. But none of them-- none of them, they're kneeling down and-- and begging to the Nazis for their life. They died with dignity. Even when they had to march to the gas chamber, they died with dignity. They were dying with prayers, because they couldn't resist. They couldn't kill Nazis. Anywhere that the Jew could re-- resist-- example, Wallenberg dressed up many Jewish boys with the Hungarian Nazi uniforms. I was happened to be-- I didn't want to tell all the details-- I was in a-- a particular place when I saw them. I thought that they are Nazis because they were wearing the-- the-- the-- the Arrow Cross. That was the Arrow Cross uh, uh, uh, uh wrist band. And later we find out, when we were, uh, took away from that building, they were fighting, the Germans, they were destroyed. We looked back. They were destroyed, because the-- the Germans overcome them with trucks, with the-- with-- with the-- with, uh, tanks I wanted to say-- not trucks, with tanks. And they-- they shot them to death. They didn't survived. But they resisted. Anyone who had a gun, who had the opportunity, they fighted. Those who didn't have-- because underground we didn't have. But if someone-- someone had a chance to-- to met Wallenberg or met, uh, some Zionist underground organization, that was the only underground. I'm not talking about the underground that was existing in the Warsaw ghetto, uh, so the Warsaw-- uh, in the ghetto the Jewish people got gun. The gun was smuggled into the ghetto. We didn't have that kind of underground. We didn't have any chance to fight against them. But we fighted our own way. Because what is this, if it's not fight, when I was running away each time, didn't care what will happening with me. I didn't give in my life so easily. So the others didn't. But some of them didn't have a chance to escape from the cattle car. Some of them didn't have Wallenberg. "], ["help from non-Jewish locals", "INTERVIEWER: You mentioned Wallenberg. That was one man who was able to do so much. Were there other people-- Hungarian Nationals-- who helped? Did you know of any Hungarians who tried to help? AGNES: Later, I find out one-- not too many, a handful. I tell you why. Not because other Hungarians were very bad. You'll find among of them nice people too. But they were scared from the others. They didn't know whom to trust. They didn't trust their own neighbors. Beside the point, many of our friends-- because we are associating with, uh, gentle people-- naturally, I grew up with gentiles. We used to live in a mixed neighborhood. I go to the re-- to the re-- to the regular public school. They've had all our friends. And many of them turned against us because they wanted to have our belongings. And it wasn't enough just to take away our belongings, but they took away our life-- I mean, our beloved one lifes too. "], ["explaining her children what happened to relatives", "So naturally, spiritually and mentally affect us-- how can I explain to my children when they were little and they ask me the question, they our neighbor grandparents are coming to visit them. They are not having grandparents. My mother was the only survivor. But my husband parents were killed instantly in-- in Auschwitz. My father was killed. And my children, when they were little, asked the question where they are? Explain that to little k-- kids, where they are. I tried to explain. I told to my, uh, uh, little babies, when they were little and they started to talk, they are in Heaven. How did they-- how come they are in heaven and the other grandparents are here. When they grew, I explained to them what was going on. And they grew up with that thought. I didn't want to spoil them in this period. "], ["not becoming \"an animal\"", "And I'm very proud of myself, I didn't became an animal. I am not. I'm proud of myself, and I'm proud of the other survivor who didn't became a animal. Because what we went through, it wouldn't be surprising if we would become animal. After deliberation, Budapest was in war. You know, they were fighting from house to house. Guns were everywhere in underground. We didn't lift up one gun to think-- with the thought in my-- in our mind to kill somebody. No. "], ["after liberation", "We were grateful to God to saved our life, and we were hoping our beloved one will return. And we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Unfortunately, they didn't come back. Some of them came back, some survivors. And we were helping them how much we could, because we didn't have too much either. And anything which was hidden in some gentile-- gentile homes was-- some-- some people gave us something, gave us something. But most of the people kept everything. "], ["finding possessions after the war", "As I said previously, my father was antique dealer. And he had the chance and opportunity during the night-- the first night, when he realized that the following day he cannot open his store-- to smuggle out from the store a few antique, uh, uh, porcelain, you know, figurines, which were a-- a-- a-- a great value, and also a-- a few Persian rugs. And-- and he gave that to certain friends. We didn't get the Persian rugs back. We didn't get the figurines back. We didn't have other pieces back. But the person said the Russian took everything away from-- from them. And after a few months later, they opened a delicatessen store in the downtown Budapest. INTERVIEWER: Did that make you bitter? AGNES: That? Because they took away those things, and they didn't return it? No, I'm not materialistic. Except, I have to watch out whom I am associating with in the future. I have to be careful. I still have, uh, friends among of the gentiles. You cannot reject everyone. You cannot-- you cannot live in this world, uh, without a suspicious mind. This is an enemy of yours, because then you are sick. But you have to be careful. And-- and-- and you have to pray to God. Shouldn't ever never happen something like this, anywhere in the world.

GREGOR: But, uh, so I never actually claimed my birthplace Germany, but originally it is Germany. LAUREL VLOCK: Yes, that's all right. So you-- when you were an infant you-- you lived in Latvia. Where? GREGOR: In Latvia, all my life, all my schoolings, everything in Latvia, yeah. In the town where we live was Libau. And in-- in Latvian it's called Liepaja And in Russian it's called Libava "], ["family", "LAUREL VLOCK: What was your family life like? GREGOR: I beg your pardon? LAUREL VLOCK: Your family life, what was it like? GREGOR: Well, our family life, we were, I believe, six children, four sisters and two brothers. And we all, we had a little small factory of soft water drinks. And the whole family worked in the [INAUDIBLE], no outsiders at all. It was very small. And the family was a Hasidic family and were observant. And we were the only factory in Libau closed on all holidays and Shabbat.

I always sang as a choir boy in the-- the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] what was called, the only temple with a choir, children's choir and adults in a great cantor. And I started to sing there as an altar boy, six years old. And we went to a Hebrew day school where my uncle was the chief rabbi [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] was a famous personality in Libau. He was the head of this day school. And as years went on, my parents wanted me to go into the rabbinate. But five generations before me were all Rabbis and cantors. And I don't know what happened, so to say, overnight that this great professor, Professor [SPEAKING GERMAN] from Vienna came to visit, you know, in Libau, his old mother. And he heard me sing at a relief concert for the local Jewish hospital a few songs. And after I came down from the stage, I was only 17 years old, not yet 17. It was in the summertime. And he said, seems to me you have a great voice. What are you doing? I said, well, I live here. I studying now. He said, I think you should, uh, try seriously to become a singer. You do have, you are blessed by nature with a beautiful voice. And I would like you should sing for me tomorrow. And I did audition for him the next day. And that was very upsetting to me, that after I auditioned and he said you have a great voice, I had to pay for the audition. Anyway, I didn't tell my parents. So it went by, about months, they said, but how can you support yourself? Well, my parents haven't approved, they can't send me to Vienna to study. And they said, what can you do? Do you have some trade? I said, well, I know some watchmaking. My uncle in Libau had a watchmaking store. And I always loved watchmaking. And I knew how to fix watches. He said, I have many people in Vienna who are watchmakers. They will give you work. I will try to achieve what I can do a scholarship for you in the conservatory. And this was the end of it. And after four weeks, we received mail. And I didn't tell my parents yet. It was German, certainly. My older sister knew languages very well. And he has talked to some people who would like to employ me in Vienna. And he can arrange for a scholarship for me at the [SPEAKING GERMAN] Conservatorium. LAUREL VLOCK: What year was this?

"], ["music", "Well, whole family got together, what to do. And my sister sent a letter to the professor. LAUREL VLOCK: What year was this, sir? GREGOR: And this was in year, I think, 1931. And the family decided finally to send me to Vienna to study, study music, to study voice. My family never had the idea that I will become an operatic singer. This was out of the question. But coming to Vienna and listening to the beautiful music and listening to the-- to such great singers, it was a center of music. Well, my professor decided that my future will be as an operatic singer. Family got together $7, I remember, and a ticket. And I came with $7 in my pocket to Vienna to study. "], ["in Vienna", "It was very difficult. If I would have had another ticket to go back, I would have gone back in two weeks. While what he promised me was, in a sense, true, but not true. You could not work there with a Latvian passport. You had to be an Austrian to make a living in Vienna. This was strictly forbidden to work as a student and to earn money, taking away the livelihood from another man. They misunderstood him, what he said. They thought that I live out of the town but I am an Austrian, anyway, I didn't have it. So it was quite a struggle for nine months. He was nice to me. He supported me with meals. And it was difficult. In a short time, I had 22 apartments in Vienna. I paid a small amount for two weeks then I had to move out. It was difficult. It was very difficult. And again, it was luck, after nine months I sang again at a relief concert for the Jewish community of Vienna what was called the [SPEAKING GERMAN] in Vienna. This was like in a government. And there again a man, [SPEAKING GERMAN] chief secretary of the [SPEAKING GERMAN]. And he asked me to sing for his son who is a violinist and who is a conductor in a temple. And this was [SPEAKING GERMAN] It was a big name in Vienna. And he gave me his card. And the next day I sang for him. First question, he asked if I'm Jewish. I said yes. I didn't look Jewish. I was very blonde. And I speak the language German best than-- better than English. I speak many other languages. But German was very, very close to me, the language. And he engaged me to sing as a choir soloist where he was conductor in a temple. LAUREL VLOCK: How long were you staying in Vienna? How many years did you stay? GREGOR: I beg your pardon? LAUREL VLOCK: How many years did you stay in Vienna? GREGOR: I stayed for 4 years. I stayed 4 years. It's-- I graduated [SPEAKING GERMAN] Conservatorium. LAUREL VLOCK: And then you went back to-- to Latvia? GREGOR: No. In my first engagement was in Switzerland and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] was one of the leading tenors. I created 12 major parts. LAUREL VLOCK: Well, how did you get interned in the Riga ghetto? What made you go back to Latvia? GREGOR: Well, this is a very good question. "], ["back to Latvia", "I went back to Latvia that the Latvian counsel in Vienna, as long as I was a student, I didn't have to go back to make my military duty. Everyone in Latvia at the age of 21, you had to go into to do your military duty as a soldier for 11 months, everyone. And now, that they heard that I am not anymore a student in Vienna and I reached 21, my 21 birthday, if I wouldn't have gone back, I could never go back to Latvia to visit my parents. And this was the reason I decided to go back. "], ["the Russian occupation", "LAUREL VLOCK: So you served in the Latvian army? Uh-- GREGOR: I served in the Latvian army for a very short time, yeah. LAUREL VLOCK: Not the 11 months? GREGOR: Not for a full 11 months. LAUREL VLOCK: Why? GREGOR: The reason, while under this period when I served, the Russians came in and occupied the Baltic without a war. They came in to liberate us. And this why-- this is the reason I didn't finish, even, my military duty. Certainly, Latvia couldn't stand up against Russia. So they occupied Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania without a war. LAUREL VLOCK: This was the year, what, when this happened? GREGOR: This was the year in-- in, uh, 1939 until 1940. Uh, we happened to be Russian citizens for nine months. "], ["antisemitism", "LAUREL VLOCK: Were you worried about, uh, if, uh, about the Jewish situation at that time? GREGOR: Well, the Jewish situation was immediately changed when the Russians came in, immediately. Uh, the first thing, they took away all the big factories and all the big stores. They, at, the people, the intelligentsia, so to say, immediately suffered in this case, you know. The people who have been in my field felt a little bit better, while, up to then, we didn't have Jewish operatic singers in the Riga National Opera. Well, I don't know if you're familiar with the Latvian situation, the Latvians, from way back, have been very anti-Semitic. They happened to be the greatest help to-- to the Germans, to the SS, the greatest help. I don't know if you know that's, uh, the last trial in Riga under the Russians, they ask, uh, the Major [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] who was in charge of occupied Latvia, how come they have chosen Latvia and brought in so many German Jews and the hundreds of thousands to be killed in Latvia? And the answer in German he gave at this trial was that the [SPEAKING GERMAN], the soil, you know, of Latvian soil was willing to do this dirty work. And also, you must have known through many, many books, that many Latvians sent-- we were-- have been sent to Warsaw to do the killing in Warsaw, also in [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] in [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], in many different places. 90% of the Latvian population became SS in uniform. So when the Russians came in, certainly they didn't kill people. But immediately, they liquidated, let's say, they had three daily Jewish newspapers, they cut it down to one daily newspapers, to one daily Jewish newspaper. And my father, an example who was a supporter of all the daily newspapers, he was lost without the Jewish languages. Then the language at home was Yiddish, you know, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. And after six months, they wiped out even the last newspaper. They warned me as I was engaged, you know, in the Riga National Opera, not to go into a synagogue. They will take pictures of me. This doesn't go as-- as an employee of the government that I should be an observant Jew. That doesn't go. LAUREL VLOCK: Were are you at all especially concerned? You had been in Vienna when Hitler came to power. So you must have known what the German attitude about Jews was better than other people in Latvia, perhaps? GREGOR: Yes, that's true. When-- when, the summer I came back from Switzerland and, uh, Hitler marched into Austria, this is the year I left, but there was no such inkling in anybody's mind-- that-- we knew something is going to be hard. It's propaganda of years back against the Jew, everything else, but we have never heard, then, of concentration camps. And we have never heard then, of killing people. This was out, far out of our-- our mind. Even in ghetto, when the first big ghetto was liquidated and they called it [SPEAKING GERMAN] you know, \"to bring the people to different places.\" And the [SPEAKING GERMAN], the people who were left the ghetto, you know, they all were killed, you know? Only later, years back, we knew about it, what happened to our people when they liquidated the big ghetto. And the-- the ghetto, in Riga, the big ghetto lasted only 37 days. And then they cut it down to a small ghetto for people, younger people, who still could work, who still can help. "], ["ghetto", "LAUREL VLOCK: You were in the Riga ghetto? GREGOR: I beg your pardon? LAUREL VLOCK: Were you in the Riga ghetto? GREGOR: I was in the big ghetto. And then, I was separated from my wife and her mother, separated from my family in a smaller ghetto. LAUREL VLOCK: Because you could work? GREGOR: Because, you know, younger people, still could work, still could help. But sick people, elderly people, and youngsters, they didn't need.

LAUREL VLOCK: Why didn't they take your wife with you to the smaller ghetto? GREGOR: Why? They? They could-- they separated immediately, the men from the women, and there was no choice. My wife could have gone with me. They selected 300 young women only from the big ghetto, only 300 young women.

Well, they selected you from the ghetto, to be, I worked with other 12 Jews in this on-- on [SPEAKING GERMAN] it's called, a street. LAUREL VLOCK: What does the word mean? GREGOR: [SPEAKING GERMAN] That says had you stay overnight and you worked there at the place. And they didn't bring you back to the ghetto. They selected people particular who could speak their language. Well, I worked in this place. It's called, uh, um, a litt-- let's say, a motel. This house was converted for a motel for officers only. And they could stay there for three nights only. And then they went to the front, officers. We then had, I must tell you this, that already we had the yellow star on the left-hand side and the big star, you know, in the back. And for Jews, we're not allowed to walk on the sidewalks, only in the middle of the street, and not alone, only with a German guard. Well, many times we had to go from our working place to the ghetto. Particular tools, when I needed a tool, I worked as an electrician as many, many different work, you have to know-- you have to do something as specialist to stay, really, alive. Otherwise, they didn't need you. At this place where I worked, and I worked most of the time nights. And they used to come in, you know, the officers, and to register them and take away their luggage, this was my job. And some of my friends and colleagues worked downstairs in the cellar at the heating system. All slave labor, one was a doctor, a physician who worked, uh, with me. And we stayed at least, I must say, we had it better by not being in the ghetto with the other people and having a place where to sleep and food.

LAUREL VLOCK: Who were you stealing from? Where would you steal from? GREGOR: Well, I'll tell you funny s-- give you an example. When they send you out to work at the port, Riga had a big port, and their food came in, particular liquor. And this was the time that you could organize, it's called, some of the liquor and change this for bread. You didn't need liquor.\t "], ["liquidating the ghetto", "I, um, have gone to the ghetto a day before the little ghetto was liquidated completely. After the signal, you know, in the Warsaw ghetto, and this is very well known, that's they collected ammunition. In every small ghetto we had this idea not to die as sheep, you know, and to have, you know, at least kill a few Germans and a few Latvians. And everyone was obligated to bring-- bring in ammunition and whatever you could to the ghetto. Now, I must tell you a very interesting story. The man who was in charge where I worked was [SPEAKING GERMAN]. This was his name. He was in charge. And as I-- he came, it was 12:30 at night, from a movie, from drinking, he was drunk. And this house has an-- had an elevator. And I was bringing him up the elevator and he said to me in German, certainly, that tomorrow the whole ghetto is going to be, on Monday, this was on Saturday night, that the whole ghetto is going to liquidate and all the sick people and the children left will be eliminated. And I didn't know if this is true or not. And the next day, 6 o'clock in the morning, And I had to wake him up. He had to make that report to the [SPEAKING GERMAN]. And matter of fact, at 6 o'clock in the morning in his own home, I listened to the broadcasting from London, was-- was strictly forbidden. But he was so drunk, I knew he would not be awake. And I listened. Then, the news, you know, it was very important for our people to bring in, that the front is coming closer, you know, that the Germans are losing. That was very important. And as I listened to the broadcast, I was shaking him. And he said throw cold water on me. Then he had to be in the [SPEAKING GERMAN] 7 o'clock in the morning. Now, I didn't know then but he'd told me. That this is a true story, that all the Jews are going to be liquidated. All of them who are not going out for work on Monday morning as working people.

I know my parents in Latvia, in Libau, we had so many rumors that Libau, not a single Jew is left. And this is true. They are finding far few people left from Latvia, in particular, not in the small cities. They were all liquidated. Early, in 1942, my parents and my sisters and brothers. They were all were liquidated then. I know that in 1942, my father was taken away, I heard it from some other people. This was before Yom Kippur night. And he never returned, certainly. Nobody ever returned, you know. "], ["coming to the ghetto to warn from liquidation", "Now, I want just to tell you this story that I told [SPEAKING GERMAN] that I have to go into ghetto. I want to relate this message to the whole ghetto.

And he had to return back to the ghetto while he couldn't work. And he was bandaged with-- with paper bandage, nothing, you know. And as I came into the ghetto, I couldn't go alone. I had to have a German who was leading me into the ghetto four miles from my place where I worked. And he was very mad, this was on a Sunday morning, that I disturbed his Sunday. So I had this bottle of Hennessy what I stole the same week before. And I gave him the bottle of Hennessy, should keep quiet. The reason why I said to myself I have to go, I need some electric tools. And, you know, in ghetto, we had plenty of different things, you know, Jewish people know how to organize and how to-- how to get along. And this was the reason I couldn't go alone. He on a bicycle. His name was Schmidt. I remember it like today. He was a corporal in-- in the SS. And he on a bicycle, I running after him in the ghetto.

They had railroads going direct, you know, to the gas chambers. And from the gas chambers into the oven. And our own people, a commander of 20 Jewish people, helped them, those poor people, to bring them in. They thought that they would stay alive, you know? But they had better food than we. They selected them. Because they didn't have a choice. But some of the people wanted to be there, you know, and help us poor people going into the chambers.

And the first thing, whatever trade you have, they didn't need anyone who was a singer or a doctor or a professional. They didn't need those things. Better to say that you are not a singer, that you are a mechanic. This was important. And as we were standing there with one of my colleagues, the colleague was, now, was a great cellist, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. And we talked to each other. The next profession, whatever they call, we have to run out. Otherwise, it's not good. To stay there in the camp, this was your end. As a working man, you had always a chance to steal and to get food. Now, they called electric welders. And we both ran out. First, you had to run 200 meter to see that your health is still good, that your physical health is still OK. And the rest who could not make it the 200 meters were sent on the left-hand side. And we know the answer, they were-- they were [SPEAKING GERMAN], that called. They were food for the oven, immediately. They didn't go back to the barracks. They went immediately you know, to the oven, to the gas chamber, to the oven. Now, as we came out, and this director asked me how long did I work as an electric welder, I said five years. Five years? OK. "], ["working in Danzig", "And the same night, they send us by a transport to [SPEAKING GERMAN] in Danzig. This is a place where they used to build the boats. They still build the boats today.

So he got angry, took the mask back, and the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] and showed me how to do it, you know, how to weld. And we were an-- very anxious to do it. First, it's under a roof, you know? And you get something to eat. And in a short time, I became a very good welder. From 12-- I worked only nights, I want you to know, only nights. And from 12:00 to 12:30, they had a coffee break, so to say. Very few Jews only left. And they had Italian, French work\u2014 all kind of workers. They had a half an hour at break and they used to get hot soup and bread, not the Jewish workers. I want you to know, all the workers had this jacket on. You could not escape that you are-- and as I was pulling on a-- on a big crane, one piece to another piece to combine them together, one of my colleagues wanted to be very helpful and said, you see this man, he's-- he's an opera singer.

Then our place to-- to s-- to work, to sleep, was 20 miles, by trains they transported them, in a small train, to work at the [SPEAKING GERMAN] in Danzig. And in this camp, we didn't have water. A camp without water, I want you to know this. And typhus, and all kind of sickness we had this in this camp. But they allowed us to take in a can, water from our working place. Now, this man built for me an-- another can underneath and poured in his soup, I should have soup. And as we marched out from the working place, they controlled us constantly. And we didn't have heat. And everyone was obligated to take a piece of coal or a piece of wood and get it under your arm and march out like this, they shouldn't control you, you know. This man, the first thing, he used to come in, he used look for a piece of wood and not to go longer than my coat. They shouldn't see it. This was his first job, this wonderful, wonderful man. I want you to know that the first thing after I was released from the hospital, from a Russian military hospital, then, the Russians liberated us. The front was going a different way. And I went on a special permit by the Russians after I was four months in the hospital with typhus-- that's a terrible sickness, I was reduced to 80 pounds at the end of the war-- to find this man. I could not find him. Then, Danzig was bombed out. There was not a place to stay for me overnight. There was not a single house left. They leveled that. While there was a big port, all the ship's upside down. You know? This man, and I wish we would have had more gentle people like him. Now, many of the gentle people, they are much afraid even to talk to you. They thought immediately you know, they had some connection with them. This man didn't know what to do for me. You know, this bringing in, not only food, the soup, but bringing in wood for the stove was very important. Important first, for body heat, and secondly for the terrible lice we had. So we used to heat this oven in the center. In the barrack, we had one-- some 40, 50 people. And we used to take off the clothes. "], ["lice and diseases", "And the-- the lice, they used to pop.

And he made a-- another key to his toolbox, then he changed to days work and I worked only night, that I should go to his tool box and take out some food and some razors to shave yourself. He also dared to do and to put on a pair of working pants and the pants were from this material, too. And we went in on an empty U-Boat. And he asked me to undress myself. And he gave me a working pair of pants up to here. And he brought me in-- in the working place for a shower. You know what that meant? A shower? To have a shower on your head. And I fainted immediately. But my German was very good. We talked, you know, to each other. And he let me have a shower. The shower was only-- not for Jews, only for the Gentile workers. And after my field, what were called, was liquidated. And they didn't have any more material for my field. And he knew that I had to go working on the water. And he didn't want me to go out in the bitter cold working on the port, you know. There when you didn't do it right they pushed you in the water like nothing, like flies. You know, they didn't care about you. So he went to another master under a roof and he said, I have a marvelous worker for you. He is an excellent specialist. And he brought me in to this specialist. Now, the man gave me a blueprint. And I tell you, I didn't know should I hold it this way, this way, I couldn't read a blueprint. And he said, in back are all the parts, 38 parts, and you have to put them together. And this was a gadget what the Germans find out after, by the end of the war, when a U-Boat goes down and it can't come up anymore, one by one, they pushed out the human being under the water to come up top. And I worked on this-- on this part. And as I was anxious to put it together, I called the new master and said, is this right? He said, I don't know. He didn't know himself. He said a French worker worked on this project here. But they took him away to another part. And he was nice. And he started to work with me, helping me along. And he put the blueprint in the proper perspective. I didn't know even how to hold it. And when one gadget was ready, I was not so stupid, I followed the numbers. And then I put.

LAUREL VLOCK: Why-- wha-- what motivated him to help you? GREGOR: Excuse me, I didn't hear. LAUREL VLOCK: What motivated him to help you? GREGOR: He said to me when he heard that I am an operatic singer, he said, and you have to do this slave labor only while you are born a Jew? This was his first remark. He couldn't get it in-- what did you commit? To them, you know, to the outside world, when you have these clothes on, they thought you were a prisoner, you were a murderer, you are something, to the outside world. So he could not understand. He said, this is why they locked you in? For you are a Jew? So to them, it was something, was new. LAUREL VLOCK: Did he ever ask you to sing for him? GREGOR: No. He never asked me to sing for him. LAUREL VLOCK: He never heard you sing? GREGOR: He never heard me sing. LAUREL VLOCK: He just believed that you were? GREGOR: He believe while through my language. And I know so many languages and everything else. And he asked what opera, what opera did you sing? And I said the Rigoletto and the Pagliacci and Butterfly and Tosca, what I created so many times, you know, in German and in Latvian language. In the Riga National Opera, they sing only in Latvian language. Only two operas we sing in Russian. [ NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I mean, and then Russians came into us, you know. But this man, I'm tell you, everyone will tell you a different story how they survived. And it's true. And I must tell you if I am an American born here and to listen to those stories, I could not believe that you could survive with the treatment and seeing these killings daily. And to hold back a man who died with me on the same bed on top, you know, and not to report him, while to get his piece of bread. Can you imagine a thing like this? Not to report him.

And if it's not, if somebody is-- is-- it's-- it doesn't coordinate with their books, they used to stay for two, three hours, an appeal, it's called, 'til everything was intact. LAUREL VLOCK: The man did you ever find him? GREGOR: Never. Never. LAUREL VLOCK: Do you know his name? GREGOR: His name was Danziger. As Danzig, his name was Mr. Danziger. Short man, I see his face in my dreams all the time. Such a kind man, could not get it in his head why do people have to suffer while they are born Jews. For what? And he himself, had to be very careful, you know? Always yelling at me and screaming at me and then, coming closer, said, here, we're gonna find some bread. He even finds a piece of wood.

I had a-- a younger sister, who perished on the journey from Vilna to here, and a younger brother who died right after birth, not related to the problems that we experienced. My father was a-- was and is a secularist. A Yiddishist, Jewish, but not a practicing Jew who practices Judaism. Much more attuned to what he defines as Jewish culture in secular terms. So the family life was good in that it was a large and extended family. He was one of many brothers and sisters, and my mother was one of many brothers and sisters. They were born in a small town outside of Vilna, Haydutsetshik or Adutiskis, sometimes known as the insane asylum of Eastern Europe, but I think every small town claims that title.

But it turns out that part of the Stalin-Hitler pact-- when Stalin and Hitler divided that part of Lithuania-Poland between them, our town, Vilna, and the regions around it, the small towns, stadtle, wound up on the Russian side of the division. So I remember Soviet troops marching in. This is '39. Vague memories, but soldiers-- little boys remember soldiers probably better than anything else. So they marched in. Somehow or other-- I now understand why-- we wound up on the Russian side, and we were packed off and sent to Siberia. Why? Because my father refused to accept Soviet citizenship. INTERVIEWER: Not because he was Jewish? ROBERT SHULKIN: Not because he was Jewish. He refused to accept Soviet citizenship under any circumstances, and he, with many others, were simply rounded up. This is before the war broke out-- before World War II broke out. INTERVIEWER: Was he such a loyal Lithuanian, or? ROBERT SHULKIN: No, I don't think he was a loyal Lithuanian. I think he was a loyal anti-communist at the time. Uh, he somehow felt and understood from his assessment of the situation and in his study that he did not want to lose-- the citizenship I think he held that the time was Polish, because in '39, Vilna was Poland, and so he had Polish citizenship. He somehow was reluctant to surrender Polish citizenship. So they shipped us off. "], ["the train to Siberia", "It was a lengthy journey. I remember a great deal about that journey, but again, they're vignettes, small, et cetera. INTERVIEWER: That's what we-- ROBERT SHULKIN: We were put into cattle cars by the Soviet troops. Each cattle car had-- I couldn't estimate the numbers of people, but it was tightly packed. There were shelves, and people sort of stayed on the shelves-- the-- the kind of shells, I think, you must be familiar from seeing photographs of the Nazi transport trains. It was a similar kind of train. We were never told where we were going. We were simply taken. It took approximately two and a half weeks of travel with lots of stops, and breakdowns, and that sort of stuff. Bored is is kind of memory. Thirst is a memory. Strangely, it was the fall when we took off, but we did not always have adequate water. I don't remember being hungry. I will then assume that my parents somehow always managed to get a piece of bread or a piece of something for somebody to chew. Noise, wailing, screaming. I remember one stop, which was memorable because it had to be explained to me later what happened. We had stopped in a fairly large population center somewhere in central Russia, I would say-- south central. And there was a great hullabaloo-- soldiers running around. I remember bayonets more than guns somehow. Maybe I was such a little kid I remember the glistening bayonets, people running, and chasing, and-- and finally after some time things got straightened out. And it turned out two Jews from the train had escaped while we had stopped. With this train, they had somehow managed to get out of one of the cars and took off for parts unknown. INTERVIEWER: So the transport was filled with Jews that-- I mean the discrimination was against Jews, not just people who-- ROBERT SHULKIN: Well, two Jews escaped. There were non-Jews on the train. This particular incident with the escape increased the non-Jewish population by two, because the Soviet guards of the train immediately grabbed two Soviet citizens and threw them into the car. Well, it's simply because the head of the train-- the person in charge had a certain number of people he had to deliver to the port of debarkation. Let's say it was 2,000. Well, you certainly cannot deliver 1,900 and two short, you know? So he threw these two people. They both-- "], ["NO_TOPIC", "INTERVIEWER: We have to raise your mic, sir. I'm sorry. We're having audio problems. No, just-- it's OK. There's-- CREW: something. INTERVIEWER: Yes. You're-- he's talking off-mic. That's-- CREW: let's just you can't really clip it here, I don't think. INTERVIEWER: Will you just continue talking-- the tape is rolling-- so that we know if it's all right? "], ["the train to Siberia", "ROBERT SHULKIN: Well, so he had to deliver two extra people. He took two people-- random. These people wound up in the train. One of them I remember vividly, because he was a very lively sort of fellow. He was a Ukrainian, and he was always into something-- always either complaining or praising the Soviet government. When he got food, he praised it. When he didn't get any food that day, he ranted, and raved, and cursed Stalin to hell and tarnation. And he spent the entire time after we got to Siberia-- he and the other fellow spent the entire time of internment with us until 1941 when the general amnesty, uh, freed Polish citizens. The amnesty, of course, came about as a result of Germany attacking Russia. Well, the train went along in its journey. "], ["continuing the journey to the camp", "We arrived at a city that I, again, remember fondly, because those-- those things stick. Others don't. The city is called Kotlas. It is a port on the Northern Dvina River, and it was, for many years, a central point of disbursement of people to the various camps and the-- what has now come to be known as the gulag system, as the Soviet camp system. It's a giant city. We were then taken off the cars from the train and put aboard a river boat is the best way I can explain it. And again, memorable because I remember the river boat somehow for some strange reason was not at any dock, but we had to walk-- literally walk a plank from the river boat-- from the shore to the river boat. And I remember someone falling in and a great deal of screaming. And this river boat then took us-- I think after a day's journey or a day plus-- to the permanent camp. "], ["in the camp", "The camp was called [INAUDIBLE]. It was about 200 kilometers north of Archangel. And in that camp, we spent, uh, two years. The camp was organized in barrack fashion-- long wooden barracks. I now know-- again, through my own desire to know, and remember, and to refresh whatever I didn't remember, or didn't know it from my parents and other inmates with whom we still keep in touch from that camp-- there were 28 families in that barrack that we stayed in. By and large, the families in our barracks tended to be from the same region. That is from the Vilna and Haydutsetshik region. We all stayed together. There were cots along either side of some makeshift tables and one kind of stove-- a wood burning kind of stove. The arrival in camp was, uh-- was mixed with humor, as well as, uh, resignation. The humor was, well, if they were sending us to jail, why the hell didn't they tell us originally? Why to keep it a mystery from us for better than two weeks of travel? The resignation was the futility of not knowing how to go about, what to go about, why we were there. No one really knew what was the real reason why we were there. My father even wrote letters at that time to the president of the Soviet Union. The nominal head of the Soviet Union at that time was Kalinin, and he even got a response, which was extraordinary-- that he had a lot of explanation, so to speak. Until recently, we had this document-- disappeared about five or six years ago. The letter simply stated that the government knows what it is doing. And so we stayed there. What does one do in a camp like this? It was primarily a lumbering camp. The men, and the women, and the young people who were able were all engaged in some form of lumbering-- cutting trees, stacking trees, cleaning limbs, hauling trees, pushing them into the river when the time came for the tree flows downriver for the logs. Everything ran around this particular economy. INTERVIEWER: What did you do? ROBERT SHULKIN: Strangely enough, it was the time for exploration within the camp, running around, seeing things. It was in the wild. My first memory is absolutely scary, because I had seen a bear-- a gigantic Siberian bear. I didn't know it was dead, but it sure enough scared me. I-- it was apparently killed by the guards. Bear-- bear meat was used for eating purposes. Most of the time, it was cubs that were eaten because the flesh is tender and not unlike veal, actually. So if you want to go catch yourself cub-- but this bear was apparently killed because it was either wild or disturbed someone. And it was set up on a raft with its paws against its jaw in this manner-- set up with some sticks, so it looked quite live. And he was floated down the river. This camp was under Northern Dvina river, and I remember with a bunch of other little boys and girls being by the shore of the river, and this raft came into view with this gigantic bear sitting on top of it. Well, you never saw fellows run so fast. It was really very scary at the time, but bears in general have a lot to do with my memories of the place. The first winter there I remember-- again, we went exploring-- the children within the camp. The camp is in the woods-- very, very wild. The whole place is surrounded by what the Russians called the impenetrable forest. People who escaped never got out. They just simply died in the forest. But in the winter, the snow tends to get very, very hard and crusty, so you can walk on top of the snow. And several of the boys went walking along the snow, and unbeknownst to us, we fell into a gigantic hole, which was a trap for bears and animals, again, which were devoured. And it was very deep. We were little-- little guys, and it must've been a good six feet deep, because the bears tend to be huge. And we-- no, we spent better than the entire day screaming at the top of our lungs before somebody came about-- came around and pulled us out of the hole. So again, bears connect to my memories. My father was put in charge of a group of men because he was said to be an intellectual because he wore glasses. And they mockingly put him in charge of a group which actually did not fell the trees, but cleaned-- cleaned the trees of limbs, and then they were supposed to haul the trees by one meager horse and some makeshift cart, usually a sled type contraption. Being put in charge of the men was fairly important, but really not as important as being put in charge of the horse. Being in charge of the horse, you-- you had to answer pretty much with your life. My father was lucky that the horse, which got fed even less than the humans in the camp, did not drop dead on him. A friend of ours, who is currently in Israel, was in charge of another group, a brigade doing the same kind of work, and his horse indeed sort of dropped on him and died. The man being a Lithuanian and-- and Lithuanians are known as comedians-- somehow the situation of the dead horse struck him as humorous. And he looked at it, and he says, oh, come on, Stalin. Get up. And he called the horse Stalin. He got an additional 15 year sentence for calling the horse Stalin. He was taken out of our camp into a much more strict regime camp. "], ["the uniqueness of the camp", "This camp I think is unusual. I don't think even Solzhenitsyn has written about these camps in this entire study of the gulag system-- in that they were family camps. The families stayed-- we stayed together. "], ["the soviet treatment of Jews", "And now I will answer your question about the Jewishness. These were Jewish camps, and Solzhenitsyn, again, I don't believe writes about the specifically exclusively Jewish camps. INTERVIEWER: Did the Russians collect Jews in special camps because of the German pattern? ROBERT SHULKIN: No, I don't think so, in all honesty. I think when they came in and took those villages-- into Lithuania and Poland that they wanted a Yiddish-- the Jewish shtetl and collected those people of the-- those Jews who refused to accept citizenship. There was not that overt conscious effort to segregate, although I would guess, at this point, since it's a question that is now being, I believe, opened-- I recently read something on it which tried to defend the Soviets, saying that they did not exclusively isolate the Jews. I would guess although there may not have been a direct government policy issued saying round up the Jews of this region, but when it came time to round up, it got to be pretty exclusively Jews. And the fact that the word Jewish camps is testimony to that-- exclusively Jewish. I recently spoke to people who come from the Soviet Union, and even they were not aware that there were exclusively Jewish camps in the period we're talking between just before the beginning of World War II, and the out-- the outbreak-- those two years. "], ["contact with Germans", "INTERVIEWER: Did you have any contact after the war began with Germans? ROBERT SHULKIN: We did not have contact with Germans until much towards the end of the war after we were amnestied from the camps, after we had moved, and kept moving closer and closer to the front. My father's decision was get out as quickly as you can, and that meant following the front. So it was not till the end of the war that we ran into the first Germans, but that's later in the-- so this was the work. "], ["work in camp", "The work was hard. It was typically Soviet-- inefficient. If you stacked up all your logs in half a day, you were told to knock them down and stack them again. Keep doing that until the day was over. That's that kind of economy. "], ["food in camp", "The food situation in the wintertime was horrible. We did receive some packages-- would you believe-- that they gave us. These work packages-- INTERVIEWER: OK. ROBERT SHULKIN: --that were sent, I think, by the United States as some sort of aid to Russians. In general, they consisted of some spoiled fish-- spoiled cod-- dried cod, spoiled. INTERVIEWER: How did they know you were there? ROBERT SHULKIN: I don't think it came ex-- directly to us. Somehow the Americans-- the United States sent all kinds of food relief to the Soviets in general, and we got some of that at one time. There was-- the daily diet was simply a kind of very thin gruel or soup made out of some flour. There was supposed to be-- I understand now, again-- some minimum caloric and protein content, but that's-- that's a fiction. It was simply flour and water-- and some bread. There was an allowance of bread, black bread. The, uh, summers and-- the spring and summers were somewhat better in that being as you are in a forest environment, and if you're willing to try things, and you have some access to the forest since you're working in a forest, you could find things-- mushrooms, for example. There's nothing like Russian mushrooms. Some animal life, if you were willing and were not hesitant about dietary laws. "], ["education in camp", "INTERVIEWER: Were you getting any education? ROBERT SHULKIN: No. INTERVIEWER: None? ROBERT SHULKIN: No. INTERVIEWER: Your parents didn't try to teach you your Jewish heritage, something? ROBERT SHULKIN: Oh, I thought you meant formal education. No, not formal, but my parents did indeed teach me the alphabet, although there was very little material to use, but they made do with what they could org-- organized-- somewhat organized fashion. Not as organized as perhaps it was in other environments, because everybody was forced to work. The kids were forced then to run around. "], ["leaving camp", "INTERVIEWER: Uh, when you left this camp after two years, where did you go? Just to follow the front? ROBERT SHULKIN: Well, that's the interesting part. You see, they-- once Hitler attacked Russia, we were amnesties. We were told to go back home. Well, the irony of that is Hitler was already home. By then, Hitler had overrun the entire area, so there was no going home. So we became refugees. Some people went to the Asian-- Central Asian Russia, Uzbekistan, Tashkent being the major center of refugees. Some, as I said, wound up all the way in Tehran. Some went out in Harbin in China. We just kept moving, jumping trains, jumping freights, buying your way, bartering your way. But first, we were taken from the camps and delivered back to that city of Kotlas, where you had to receive tickets to move out of Kotlas. You had to stay in line for tickets. We stayed in line for two weeks for the exit tickets. That means living in line. At the railway station in Kotlas, you stayed, you lived, you did whatever else people do in the line and made sure you kept the place until you got those tickets out. INTERVIEWER: Couldn't somebody stand in line-- ROBERT SHULKIN: Well-- INTERVIEWER: --while you left? ROBERT SHULKIN: Well, but people went foraging for food, bartering for food, yes, but no one gave up places in line. And so we got-- in any train, leaving was acceptable. One did not ask, does this train go to Moscow, Kharkiv, or Kiev, or Paris? You merely took whatever train was available and left. After two years in the camps, people were sickly, weakened. The health situation-- the hygienic situation was not great for two weeks staying in line. We finally got tickets, and we got some sort of train, which started moving out of Kotlas, heading south. And my young sister became ill. We now know that she probably had typhus. She cut typhus-- typhoid fever. And after a few days on the train, she died. She died in my mother's arms. Well, the Russians had a habit of taking children who died on the train and merely throwing them out the window on the side of the road. So my mother-- her blessed memory-- made pretend that her child was not dead. She kept her for two days at her breast pretending that her child was not dead, but finally it became clear to the guards-- and there were-- there were always guards, although this was not an officially guarded train, I don't believe. I can't even remember. It was found out, but my father somehow bartered, bribed something, gave a piece of clothing, a shoe, anything, whoever was in charge, and we were permitted to leave. "], ["living near Kirov", "It turned out to be at a fairly-- at a stop at a fairly large city. The city's called Kirov in north central Russia. And we got off the train because my mother wanted her daughter to have some kind of burial instead of being thrown from the train like a dead puppy. So that's where my sister is buried. So we stayed for a while in that city. My father foraged around. His sister and family also stayed with us. They also got off. We decided to stay together as two families. They are now in Israel. And after a few days of survival, of bartering, of borrowing, and stealing-- it was not uncommon-- the-- all the people of the family decided to remain in this area. It was not a bad area. We moved away from the city itself-- from Kirov into a small village called Pachar. The village was largely populated by Russian sectarians, or what they call the old believers, a group that traces back to a split in the Russian Orthodox Church dating back to the 17th century. But they were very kind and decent people. Some of their beliefs and at least their practices are not unlike American Quakers. And we stayed in the village with these people until the very end, as it was becoming clear that the war was going the way of the Allies. And we then started moving out from there. INTERVIEWER: To where? ROBERT SHULKIN: Moving again towards-- the first intention was to get back to Poland, not necessarily to Vilna. And so we headed that way. We stay in the village from '41 until late '44. It wasn't that unpleasant. I went one grade of school-- not quite one grade. Didn't finish it. To a-- to a Russian first grade school, where I stayed with the Russian boys and girls. I was pretty-- pretty klug; I even won a prize once of a package of tea for good spelling. My father worked as a shoemaker this time in this little village. My mother worked. Everybody worked, and the people were very kind. They were by and large farmers, and thanks to their good efforts at farming, food was probably better than for many other people in Russia during the war-- with one exception, the year '41, which was a great famine year throughout, but these people gave us food. For example, they would not eat flesh-- animal flesh-- if that animal was killed by another animal, and since the area was filled with bears and wolves-- at one point wolves attacked and killed a cow on a-- that belonged to the village. And the villagers would not eat that cow. Well, we had enough meat for an entire winter. It was good meat. So they were very kind and decent people. I remember them. I remember everything that particular-- INTERVIEWER: Did they know you were Jewish? ROBERT SHULKIN: Yes. We were the only Jews. There were-- early on in our stay there, there were some transient Jews-- refugees walking. We did a lot of walking in these-- these five, six years. Uh, pass-- passed through us, and we-- stayed with us for a while, but they went on. They didn't remain with us. But the Russians-- they all believed us, knew we were Jews. They knew what Jews were. There was never any man-- outward manifestation of hostility on their part to us. Quite the contrary. "], ["moving from Russia", "So by the end of-- by '44, we began to move slowly, walking, jumping trains. I'm still pretty good at hopping a trolley car and getting off a trolley car while it's moving, having learned to do it from moving trains. No trains stopped in that village. It was a-- it was a semi stop. Trains slowed down in that village. And we made our way out of Russia into Poland. I remember various cities in Poland, moving with the front as cities were liberated. INTERVIEWER: What was the reception to you when you got back to Poland? ROBERT SHULKIN: I don't see as there was a reception in any-- in any normal sense of using that word. INTERVIEWER: Were people-- were people-- ROBERT SHULKIN: There were people-- INTERVIEWER: --pleasant? ROBERT SHULKIN: Yes, but there was so much confusion of movement, you see? The front was moving. INTERVIEWER: Antisemitism? ROBERT SHULKIN: I think there must have been-- I know there was some antisemitism. Again, I judge this on my father's comments. He's fairly-- much reluctant to speak about these experiences, but his decision-- for example, one of the first cities we stayed for any length of time was Reichenbach in-- in-- in Silesia-- Polish Silesia, or Reichenbach in German it's known as. And after some couple of weeks of staying after it was liberated, he said, no. No, no, no. This is no place for Jews, and we moved on to another city. We went through Breslau. Breslau was a-- a major-- a large city. It was very extensively damaged by the Allied bombings because it happened to be in a peculiar location of a triangle that was used by the Allied bombers. INTERVIEWER: But it was German, wasn't it? ROBERT SHULKIN: It was German occupied, and they-- they wiped it out. I remember going through the rubble of that city. I found a postage stamp album there, which I kept until I was in college in the United States. We were in Poznan-- went from a city there, where I remember getting lost. That must have caused no end of trouble to my parents, because I was lost for more than a day wandering the rubble in the streets of a bombed out city-- of Poznan. But my father's decision was firm, and I think it was, uh, based on experience that, uh, the thing to do was not to remain in-- certainly not in Russia, and certainly not in Poland. And so we stole the border. Uh, it was fairly easy at the time-- from Silesia, the border-- we got into Czechoslovakia. I remember being-- I must be good at this, because I got lost in Prague again. I remember being lost for over a day in Prague, because in Prague the streetcars-- the trolley cars were working. And it was such a thrill I just kept going on trolley cars for about a day and a half in Prague INTERVIEWER: Was Prague under German rule or under-- ROBERT SHULKIN: This was, uh-- Prague was already under Soviet rule From-- from Czechoslovakia, again, my father decided not to stay, I think, again, because of presence not only of-- it must have been the Soviets. "], ["in DP camps", "We wound up in, uh-- somehow in West Germany, that border. And it's at that point that we were picked up by American military personnel, who took everyone, I believe, to a central disbursement camp, which was outside of Munich. It was called Foehrenwald. It was the largest of the displaced persons camps, but I was-- or a dispersal camp, rather than permanent residence camp. We moved there for some time until arrangements were made by the American military personnel. And we were sent to a town in Bavaria, uh, with a displaced persons camp called Ulm. Ulm was the name of the town. It happens to be the birthplace of Albert Einstein. It's in Bavaria. It's right under one of the main defense lines of Nazi Germany that was broken through-- the Siegfried Line, I think it was called. And there we stayed from '45-- from 1945 in that camp until 1949. INTERVIEWER: Four years? ROBERT SHULKIN: Mm-hm. INTERVIEWER: Can you describe that, uh, experience? Four years in a displaced persons camp. ROBERT SHULKIN: Oh, yes. That was, uh-- INTERVIEWER: You were young. You were not a child? ROBERT SHULKIN: I was, uh-- I was-- when I got to the camp, I was 10 years old. And so the-- the memory is much fresher, and details are-- are clearer. Life in camp was pretty much all right. It was run by the American military authorities, MPs, in the beginning until things got organized. And there was even an internal sort of police system by the camp inmates-- guards at the gates. It was a camp that was, um-- how do you call it? Blocked off. There were-- there was barbed wire, it was not a prison camp, so you could go in and out if you worked in the city, but you stayed in this camp. There were barracks. The barracks were former German military barracks. The Americans provided immense amounts of food-- everything you ever wanted to have. And the Jews-- this was a camp, again, exclusively Jewish in the-- in the town. There were other non-Jewish camps-- DP camps. Ukrainian camp, for example. The Jews provided the rest of the life and schooling, formal organized education, where I went to study math and arithmetic, reading, writing, and the traditional study of the Chumash. INTERVIEWER: Were there efforts to get out? To go someplace? ROBERT SHULKIN: There were always efforts to get out, and the efforts were-- were primarily dual-- those who had made decisions, families who talked, and decided, and wanted to emigrate to the United States, and those who, by the end of their stay in that camp, were making plans to stay-- to go to Palestine and Israel. Many went from the camps, for example, to Cyprus. They went up to Cyprus, and from Cyprus eventually with the establishment of the state of Israel to Israel. INTERVIEWER: What was the atmosphere in the camps of people who-- ROBERT SHULKIN: Interesting. There were probably more political parties within the camp-- at least our camp, than there are in, uh, Israel now. Every known denomination of-- of-- and political persuasion-- persuasion-- INTERVIEWER: Were these people who-- who had been-- ROBERT SHULKIN: All survivors. INTERVIEWER: All survivors. Not-- ROBERT SHULKIN: Both of the Russian and the Nazi camps. Not only-- exclusively. We had Russian survivors of the Russian labor camps, but survivors of the concentration camps-- by mostly survivors of the concentration camps who were already in Germany as the camps were being liberated, I imagine, by the Americans and British So it was lively. Even newspapers were printed. Uh, journals were run. People worked at all kinds of things. Some speculated on the black market. Many speculated on the black market. It was the-- probably the major activity. I don't know that-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] INTERVIEWER: People were free to leave. Good. ROBERT SHULKIN: People were free to come and go in the camps. Although there was some check, but it was not at all rigid. INTERVIEWER: Why did they stay? ROBERT SHULKIN: First, the, uh-- it took time to get papers to find-- the first year-- the first months were for establishing contacts. If you had family in the United States, finding them, finding addresses, getting papers. Uh, those who had not intended to go to the United States, but were waiting for Pales-- for Palestine and Israel, it was a different-- it was difficult to get to Palestine. And there was the-- they were facing and already beginning to hear what life was like in the other displacement camps. For example, the tent camps of Cyprus were worse than these camps. INTERVIEWER: Did you remember the Peel Commission, or any of those commissions? Anglo American Committee? The Morrison-Grady Commission people coming to-- ROBERT SHULKIN: I remember visits. Commissions-- uh, I don't know there which exact commissions. I remember visits, uh, very distinctly. INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm. ROBERT SHULKIN: Uh-- INTERVIEWER: I guess Peel was long before ROBERT SHULKIN: A boy-- a boy's life, uh, and young-- young people's life was-- was busy in those camps. You were-- you were going to school. You were exploring. Uh, you were disobeying your parents and sneaking out of camp to go to quote unquote, \"town,\" Ulm. It's an interesting town to explore. Uh, you also engaged in-- in your own brand of politics. All boys and girls immediately aligned themselves with various groups. I was in a group called Betar, which, uh, I think is not big in government version of sorts. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any cultural activities, such as group-- a group coming from America to entertain or anything? ROBERT SHULKIN: No, I remember groups coming to entertain. I remember seeing theater, but the theater came-- I-- I know the theater, as a matter of fact, simply because it was-- friends of ours were connected. It was called MIT, not to be confused with the place across the river, but the Munchener Yiddischer Theater, the Munich Yiddish Stage Theater, which est-- got established very early in the-- after the war in Munich. And they had traveling groups putting on primarily Yiddish plays. There were also-- they also made films-- feature length films, and I saw those. I know, too, that I remember seeing-- one was about the, uh, survivors. I don't know if anybody in this country knows of the existence of such films. It was called The Long Journey. INTERVIEWER: What was the atmosphere-- not just the organization of the camp, but what was the atmosphere of the people, who-- after all, they had survived the Holocaust, and now they're still in a camp for four years? ROBERT SHULKIN: The atmosphere? It was-- it was good, strangely enough. It was we're getting back to health. We're going to get out of here. We're searching, those who were intending. Many simply intended to stay. They thought they were going to stay. You'd be surprised how resilient the human personality is-- to stay in Germany and, uh, make lives, or, uh, many went to South America. But the plans that-- the feeling was that this is really transient. So they'll take one year-- one-- didn't expect it to be four years. It's nothing one knew about. It all depended how quickly you were able to arrange exits. You had to have first-- as I remember-- I may be wrong on this-- but I remember that you had to have proof that you were in Germany in 1945 in order to get-- to then apply for papers with relatives in the United States to get out of there. INTERVIEWER: You don't remember people being angry or bitter? ROBERT SHULKIN: I think I remember being-- people being angry and bitter over that issue. There was a ruling. I think it was the high commissioner or somebody's ruling that you had to be in Germany in '45, which would mean that only those people who were in German territory concentration camps would be able to leave. Those people, let's say, who got out of Russia-- and some people got out of Russia in '46 and '47-- could not get permission to leave these camps. So I remember a great deal of frustration and anger over of the-- over the red tape. And there was always red tape. There was also American red tape. I know, for example, our family was held up at one point because of my stupidity. I was interviewed after we had gotten approval to leave. We had gotten testimony that we were there in '45. We had gotten assurances from our relatives in the States that there was a job and a-- an apartment waiting for us if we got here-- that, in other words, there was support. There were a series of interviews which one had to experience, and I remember being interviewed-- I was already 14 at the time-- by an American Army or mil-- some kind of military personnel. I'm guessing there was a division called CID of the Army-- criminal investigation division. And I know one question that I answered held us back for-- and we missed one boat-- one ship. And the question was, did I know Stalin? This was-- I'm now talking 1949, so you can imagine. And my answer to that was yes. My English was not great. Yes, meaning I knew who he was-- and got held back because I had to be investigated. So you see, it was tough. INTERVIEWER: Uh, the-- ROBERT SHULKIN: But eventually we made it out through Bremen and a US Navy transport. "], ["the issue of going to Palestine", "INTERVIEWER: The, um, issue of going to Palestine when, after all, there was British being obstacles in that process-- what was the talk about that? What was the-- ROBERT SHULKIN: Well, it was-- it was the vision, really. The camps were-- were divided. At least, this-- this camp that I can testify is. INTERVIEWER: And the name of the camp? ROBERT SHULKIN: Those-- INTERVIEWER: The name of it was? ROBERT SHULKIN: It was Ulm-- Neu-Ulm, actually. INTERVIEWER: The name. ROBERT SHULKIN: Neu-Ulm-- DP Neu-Ulm. Um, those Zionists and pro-Zionists who believed in-- in the dream of the establishment of a Zionist and Jewish state, felt that it did not matter that there were obstacles. They knew they would have to fight physically. I can tell you now, as a matter of fact, that there was military training of young kids in this camp clandestinely under the eyes-- but probably under the winking eyes of the American MPs. I was trained to-- to fire a rifle-- American military rifle. I was even trained to fire a machine gun. And I was trained in hand-to-hand combat. I was 14. I was Zionist. My father was for a long time very Zionist. On the other hand, there were those who felt that the war was enough, that they now wanted some kind of a haven where there never would have to be a need to fight, a need to struggle, and there would be a chance. There was America, South America, Europe. Many went to France, Belgium. Some stayed in Germany. Some-- I know as late as mid '50s-- stayed in German, but finally got out, or left voluntarily. "], ["black marketing in DP camps", "Many people made fortunes there during this time, I hasten to add. I know it's a subject that's probably taboo, but the black market made instant millionaires. There was a great deal of black marketeering I consciously saw between the American military and DP people, displaced persons. People made fortunes and brought those fortunes with them, but not everybody. My father came with $14 to East Boston and a-- and a toothache. The $14 went on the extraction immediately. So-- but many made a great deal of money and saw brilliant chances. The speculation went on in everything, not only the standard joke of chocolates and American nylons, but whole-- sort of almost rustler type op-- operation that you see in cowboys and Indian films where whole-- what do you call? Whole flocks of cows, whole bunches of beef were rustled and sold. That's were money was. There was a great deal of speculation in gold, and silver, and jewelry. And but the most ready item of speculation was the dollar itself. It was the object of trade and speculation. So life was-- was-- was varied. It was mixed. It was-- it was lively. Those were great cultural activities. I-- because my father always stressed reading, and literature, and history was an avid read-- reader, and there was-- there were new journals in-- in Yiddish. I wrote primarily in Yiddish-- only in Yiddish, as a matter of fact. "], ["The living conditions in the DP camp", "INTERVIEWER: Were you living in barracks? ROBERT SHULKIN: Yes. They were-- they were-- they were stone-like barracks. There were five floors in each of these barracks. Usually the barracks were two families to a room-- a large room, but the-- our room was two families. There were four people in-- in my family. My mother had given birth to a sister-- my sister, 1944, while still in the Russian village. And I saw her being born. That's one of-- one of my earliest memories. Uh, so two families in this room fairly comfortably. A curtain dividing us. And, uh, so there was a great deal of printing, and publishing, and plays, and movies, and sports organizations. And life after the establishment in '48 of the state of Israel was particularly exciting, especially for youngsters, teenagers, who saw this-- this brilliant bright hope. "], ["deciding where to live", "INTERVIEWER: Why did you not want to go there then? ROBERT SHULKIN: It's not I. INTERVIEWER: Or your parents. ROBERT SHULKIN: I think my parents' decision was-- I think my father at that point decided this was it. He had seen enough wars. He had traveled enough. He had walked enough through Europe, and he didn't want to do it again. And he simply-- it was a late decision. As late as '48, our intention was still to go to Israel. And then somehow I think-- and even my mother more so. She was already very sickly. She was to die fairly soon after her arrival in the United States at the age of 51. So it was a conscious decision, but a very late one. I was all set. I was ready to go. I had learned a great deal of Hebrew. I would-- as I said, learned all kinds of things in preparation for the new adventure, but I was 14. The disappointment was there, I'm sure, but at that age, disappointments go away as soon as you got on board a Navy transport and explored the exciting world therein. "], ["the ending, how the experience affected his life", "INTERVIEWER: We only have about a minute or two. ROBERT SHULKIN: OK, sure. INTERVIEWER: And I was just wondering what this whole experience has-- how it has shaped you. ROBERT SHULKIN: I-- I think there can be no doubt that it-- it has shaped me. It has shaped in my-- shaped me in my commitment to-- in a sense, to be the same Jew my father is-- essentially a secularist, but very much concerned with what to me means being Jewish, being knowledgeable about the totality of what it is to be Jewish, and what Jewish culture and history has taught us, to bring up my children the same way. It has, uh, I think, uh, probably directly influenced my-- for example, my stay in Russia. Influenced directly my choice of profession. There was no doubt about that connection. It was rather easy because I learned Russian when I was very young, and it came very easily. "], ["Robert's attitude for the Russians", "INTERVIEWER: And you don't-- apparently you don't house bitterness for Russian culture, because your Russian language-- ROBERT SHULKIN: Quite the contrary. Not Russian culture. Not at all. They-- I-- I hold nothing against Tolstoy. I hold everything against Stalin. It was not Tolstoy or Chekhov who imprisoned me. INTERVIEWER: Czarist Russia wasn't so great for Jews either. ROBERT SHULKIN: No, I was born, uh, uh-- not only not great, it was-- it was horrible. I have no love for the authority, but I cannot not love the culture. I cannot hate the people in the village of Pakistan, who, for all those years, cared for us and tended us, but I am not a lover of Russia-- Russian government. Again, that has shaped me in my concern with-- for Soviet emigres. Most recently in my concern with helping them in a very direct way-- in helping the children go to the universities here, in which I am actively engaged. "], ["the importance of the memory of the Holocaust", "I don't ever want to forget this experience, nor do I-- nor do I divorce the exp-- my experience, which was relatively smooth and survivable, nor do I divorce it from the experience of the Nazi concentration camps, and the Holocaust survivors, and my own concern for the need for the memory of that thing to exist forever. So I am-- at least when it comes to that issue-- not terribly sophisticated, for example. I do not believe that it is impossible to write about the Holocaust because it was so terrible, and one cannot talk about it it was so horrific. I feel very strongly that we must talk. We must remember. We must write. There was a-- I think a sixth book of the Pentateuch that must be added. It is the experience for what we call the Holocaust. I'm sure that is whatever I am, for better or for worse. The totality of the experience has made me so. Um, that is it. "], ["NO_TOPIC", "INTERVIEWER: The uh, films that we produce, they are, sort of, the tip of the iceberg. The substance of this whole project is the body of material which we are gathering. Our-- --will a subject as complicated as the Holocaust ever even be glimpsed, never mind understood. I sat here for one hour last night listening to Professor Goldhagen. MEYER STRASSFELD: Yeah. INTERVIEWER: He's certainly a very knowledgeable gentleman. I mean, this is his life-- MEYER STRASSFELD: Yeah. INTERVIEWER: And what he studies-- MEYER STRASSFELD: Right. INTERVIEWER: --his whole life. And yet, I have felt that I knew things he didn't know. MEYER STRASSFELD: Mm hm. INTERVIEWER: Not that I knew them, but I'd heard them. MEYER STRASSFELD: Yeah, you'd had heard about them, sure. INTERVIEWER: OK. "], ["name and origin", "Rabbi, would you start with your name and so forth. MEYER STRASSFELD: Do I use my title with it too, or no? INTERVIEWER: Anything. Just go ahead. MEYER STRASSFELD: I'm Meyer J. Strassfeld. I'm rabbi of Temple Sinai in Marblehead at present. I was born November 17th, 1920, in Poland. I lived there for a while with my grandparents, who lived in the city of Stanislaw. Stanislaw was a very large Jewish community, about 90,000 Jewish people. "], ["family", "My grandfather, who was a Cantor and a Shochet, was one of the leaders of the community. My father was the only one of the seven children who left Poland and migrated to Germany in 1926. My father was given the position, in a small town in Ostfriesland. The village's name was Wittmund. And there we lived for about nine years, until we were expelled by the Germans. "], ["life before the war", "As I think back to my life in Poland, it was very pleasant within the confines of my grandfather, my uncles, and my cousins. But I experienced anti-Semitism even there. I remember that my Payot, my side curls, were pulled, and I was referred to as [? [ NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], ?] which means dirty Jew, or something similar to that. When we left Poland, we settled in Germany, as I indicated. And there, my father served as the Shochet, ritual slaughterer, as the Cantor, and as the teacher of the Hebrew school. We became an integrated part of this small village, relating very well to all the people. The Jewish community consisted of about 20 families. They were very close, close knit fam-- group, very supportive, one of the other, and participated in the various activities that were the responsibility of the Jewish community. But even the non-Jewish community was a very friendly group, at least those that were our neighbors. We socialized with them. It's also true that we had the largest attic. And so they could bring their clothing and dry it in our attic. So there was always a relationship between them and ourselves. I went to school. I enjoyed school. I have two brothers, in addition to myself. We went to school together. We enjoyed our school. We were part of the school, very much accepted. "], ["applying for German citizenship", "When we applied for German citizenship, we were turned down, which was a very sad day to us, because we felt German-- we wanted to be Germans. And we were turned down, because my father had entered Germany illegally. And when he had to justify his-- the crossing of the border illegally, he used the excuse that he was a political refugee, which, of course, was put down in his records. And then the German government just turned down our application. We were very unhappy about it, not realizing that that would ultimately save our lives. "], ["hitler coming to power", "When Hitler came to power in 1933, one of the first actions were directed against what he called foreign Jews. And so all foreign Jews, including ourselves, were notified that we had six months to leave Germany and to return to our country of origin, which meant Poland. We had no intentions of returning to Poland. Poland was a very anti-Semitic country. We remembered the anti-Semitism. We certainly did not want to go back there. We did not know what was going to happen in Germany, because all of us lived with the hope that the Hitler idea would peter out very quickly. We gave him six months, a year was the most. And then we thought that the cultural German society would spit out the Nazi ideology. Of course, it never happened. Since we didn't want to go back to Poland, we attempted to get an extension. And we applied to the Zionist organization, who were in charge of emigration to Palestine. And we also had family in America. By that time already, the British had introduced a quota system. And so we were given a number somewhere in the four thousands, I recall. And we were waiting to either go there, and at the same time, we contacted family in America-- those were my father's uncles who live in Newark, New Jersey-- and asked them to be helpful in bringing us to America. "], ["the atmosphere after Hitler came to power", "INTERVIEWER: Did the atmosphere in Germany change at all a-- for you, as a young child going to school. Was there any difference for you be-- before 1933 and after 1933? Not necessarily in regard to your for-- alien status. MEYER STRASSFELD: Yes, I was going to come to that. "], ["immigrating to the USA", "Um, America came first. Because my-- my uncle-- may his soul rest in peace-- brought a contract, a rabbinic contract for my father, a small comm-- congregation in Newark. And so, we were able to enter the United States outside of the quota, because the Polish quota had been closed, oversubscribed at that time. We would have never come to this country, except for my uncle's intervention. And so we-- my father left earlier, and a few months later, we arrived in the United States, July 4th, 1935, which, of course, is an additional reason for us to celebrate that day. "], ["school after Hitler came to power", "The changes that came about, and the relationship between-- with our neighbors and the school were very abrupt and were very destructive to our psyche. The first thing, we, all Jewish students, had to sit in separate benches, segregated benches. Instead of the customary prayer that opened the class, in the morning, we began with a salute to Hitler, with heil Hitler, which we had to do. We didn't want to be picked on as being different, but it was not very easy to say it. But that was minor compared to the difficulties that we had, for example, in-- during recess, in the courtyard, the playground, we were usually beaten up. Seldom where we invited to participate with the other students. We had one teacher, who was a member of the Stahlhelm, which was the veterans' organization, who was a very sensitive soul. He began to realize that difficulties that we were having. And so he would dismiss all Jewish students five minutes earlier, before the end of class. This gave us enough time to run home before we were caught and beaten. This was reported by one of the students to the Nazi representative in our village. The man was interrogated. After a while, he was fired from his position for showing some kind of sensitivity to Jewish children. "], ["the prohibition of slaughtering animals according to Jewish law", "When Hitler came to power, one of the laws that were promulgated was anti shechita law. You were no longer permitted to slaughter animals according to Jewish law. You could only stun them first, and then slaughter them. We knew-- we knew the law, but we didn't know what was going to happen, until one day, my younger brother was asked various questions by his teacher in school, where my fa-- how many knives my father had, and how he slaughtered them, and where he kept them. And my brother answered these questions very honestly. But when he came home, he repeated the conversation. My father said, they're going to confiscate my knives. And so we-- there was nothing we could do about it. Shortly thereafter, they came. They confiscated the knives. My father very wisely saved just one knife, a very small one, which could be used to slaughter chickens. Because from that time on, we no longer ate any meat, because it was not kosher. We had no slaughtered meat at all. And I remember the difficulty. As I think back, some of it was ludicrous. And yet, we would go through this. I would go out to a farm. We lived in a farming area. Go out to a farm. Buy a few chickens. A sack on my bicycle. I was, at that time, about 12 years old, 12, 13. 13, 14 years old. And I would bring them home, and late at night, my mother would take pots and pans and bang them together while my father slaughtered the chickens. And after he slaughtered them according to Jewish law, he then chopped off the heads, so then in case there was any investigation, we would have shown, at least, that they had been killed according to the new German law. That was the way in which we were able to have some meat, at least for the holidays and for the Sabbath. "], ["the change in relationship with neighbors", "The additional changes that came about were the coolness of our neighbors. I remember going to one of our neighbors. We had had a very close relationship with them. They used our attic, and there were other things that we exchanged. They were next door neighbors. And their son had beaten up my younger brother, my youngest brother. And I went to complain to them about it. And they just laughed at it. And said, oh that was nothing. It could be worse. That kind of reaction. People would not stop to talk to us in the street, even though they had always done it before. They didn't visit our homes the way they used to. And then when, finally, we were ready to go-- and this was after my father had left-- oh, and I think even before that-- we had sold our furniture. We were not going to take it with us. And it was brought by a man who only lived, maybe, five miles away from our village. But he was afraid to send in the moving van and have the moving van take it from our home-- from a Jewish home-- back to his place, to his farm. And so he had hired a moving van from Wilhelmshaven, which is about 40 miles away from us. And they came-- that moving van came, picked up the-- our furniture, and then moved it, took it to Wilhelmshaven. And then he sent another truck to take it from there back to his home. You would go through all this expense, merely to show you are not trading, or you were not helping, any Jewish family, especially those who were, at that time, already leaving. "], ["policemen searching at the house", "My father had left before Passover, and as I was walking home from the synagogue, during Passover, I noticed that two policemen, not from our community, walking down our street. I immediately said to my friend, I says, they're going to our house. I didn't know why. But they did come. I came to the house, they were there. And they searched-- we were already packed at that time. We were leaving shortly thereafter. And they searched. They made us unpack everything that we had packed. We finally discovered what they were concerned about. And this was again, you have to remember the early years of Hitler. Hitler was still worried about what the world was going to say about him, about his ideas, and certainly about his treatment of Jews. And so, a rumor had been spread that we had taken photographs of the broken windows in the Hebrew school, which was part of the building in which we lived. We lived upstairs. That was the rabbi's quarters. Our Hebrew school was underneath, and they had smashed many of those windows. They thought we had taken pictures of that. They also thought that we had taken pictures of the boycott of Jewish stores. Because I remember living through that all. It was increased later on to a much greater extent. But during the time that I was still there, they had placed SR or SS people in front of the Jewish stores with cameras, taking pictures of anyone who went into those stores to purchase whatever they wanted to purchase. And they thought we had taken pictures of that. There had been a desecration of one or two graves on the Jewish cemetery. And again, they suspected we had done that. And so they searched everything. That even cut open some of our mattresses to make sure that there was nothing inside. We had not done any of that. But that was-- these were the things that were happening. The interesting thing is that the local policemen, at least we suspect, we don't-- we're not sure. But the local policeman refused to come and search our home. He was a next door neighbor. And we had some relationship with him. And so they imported two policemen from a small town not far from us, [INAUDIBLE], and they were the ones who did all the searching. INTERVIEWER: Did these people that searched your home show any papers of authority to do what they were doing? How did they identify themselves and prove to your satisfaction that you'd better cooperate? MEYER STRASSFELD: Yes, they had an authority. They had a search warrant. Germany carried out whatever they did in a very legalistic way. Everything was done legal. Now, for example, the knives, my father's knives that were confiscated, we had a slip of paper for it. And when we came to this country, and we applied for some reparations, this was one of the documents we were able to use. And they paid us back for those knives. So that everything was done in a very legal fashion. I think this-- this covers, I would say, probably most of our experience. "], ["on a German boat to the USA", "We came to America on a German boat. Actually, we came on the Bremen, because we-- we felt it would be safer for us to go on a German boat, to pay for it with German money, and so on. We were limited to the amount of money that one was allowed to take out. I think it was a 100 mark per person, which amounted to almost nothing. We were searched very thoroughly. But we were not among the wealthy people, or even well-to-do people, in the community. So our search was certainly more perfunctory than some of our other members of our community, who left at a later date. Many of them, I would say most of the community were saved. Most of them-- some of them were thrown into Dachau after the Kristallnacht in 1938. But they were released, and they left. But they left all their property. INTERVIEWER: What year did you leave? MEYER STRASSFELD: We arrived here in 1935. "], ["attempting to visit family in Poland", "When we left, we had wanted to go visit, at least, our family in Poland. Go there first, and then leave. However, we were advised-- and apparently, it was correct-- that once you would leave German soil, we would not be permitted to re-enter and leave from Germany. And we already had made arrangements to leave from Hamburg or Bremen, I'm not sure. I think it was Bremen. To leave from there, and so we did not. We called. We spoke to them on the phone. But we never saw our family again. And in addition to my father's very large family, my mother's family-- my mother was also born in Poland, and so her family also lived in Poland. "], ["what happened to the family left in Poland", "I want to, sort of, conclude with what happened to my family in Poland. My grandfather, as I indicated, was a very respected individual in this community. He was very well liked. He was a great scholar. The-- we were a rabbinic family, going back generations. Some of my uncles were rabbis, too, in Poland. My cousin, some of my cousins, were leading rabbis in the Polish community. But most of my grandfather's children lived with him. They lived sort of in a compound all around him. And so they were in the city of Stanislaw. And then in 1943, it was the holiday of Hoshana Rabbah, which is one of the days of the Sukkot festival, the festival of tabernacle. The Jews of Stanislaw were rounded up. The Germans always rounded up Jews, especially during holidays. So they were all rounded up, about 10,000 of them, and they were brought to the Jewish cemetery, where graves had been dug in front of them. And they were all lined up. My grandfather had around him at that time 123 members of his family, his sons, his daughters in law, his daughters, sons in law, his grandchildren, his great grandchild. My grandfather, being one of the spokesmen of his community, stood up front, addressed his community, encouraged them to die proudly, and not to give the Nazis any satisfaction, of weeping and cringing. And then he turned to the Nazi commander, and he said to him, you are vermin. You will die like vermin. And he spat into his face. He was immediately shot. And then the rest of them were shot during that day and the next day. We know about this from eyewitnesses who were there, who fell into the pit but had not been killed, who later on crawled out from there and made their way to Israel. They contacted my father, and that is how we knew of my grandfather's last days. This itself, of course, is a very difficult moment for me to remember. It is glorifying to know that my grandfather was that kind of person, who stood up to his oppressors. But on the other hand, I lost my family. An added point is that we know, through Wiesenthal's search, that's the Ukrainian who was second in command is living today, peacefully in Canada. That hurts. It hurts very much. "], ["the Hasidic culture", "INTERVIEWER: Uh, rabbi, I-- I, uh, would just like to ask a couple of questions. You obviously have insight into a cultural milieu in Poland that no longer exists. We would like to, if you could, through your own recollection, through your family stories, reconstruct that culture milieu, a lost group of people, really. MEYER STRASSFELD: My family was a Hasidic family. INTERVIEWER: Can you describe, you know, physically-- MEYER STRASSFELD: Yeah. INTERVIEWER: --their-- you said the compound. The whole-- MEYER STRASSFELD: I still remember, although I was only six years old, my grandfather had a very large home. At least, it seemed large to me at that time. And I know to go to his home, you had to go up steps. And he had-- one of the things that always intrigued me was the tremendous library that he had. There was one room, a very large room, which was covered from ground to the top. I mean, the walls were covered with books. And this was not merely a display library. My grandfather was a great scholar. And so those books were used repeatedly. And he had his family around him, which then gave him the opportunity to probably, on the one hand, to control their lives. He was a patriarch, and in that vein, wanted them to live their lives according to the Hasidic tenants that he observed, that he held high. Although, it's interesting, he permitted his sons to select different Hasidic rabbis, to whom they created some kind of adherence. My father, for example, was a Belz Hasid, which meant the disciple of Belz. My grandfather was Sadigere, which was a different group altogether. And it was very-- we accepted it, as long as his children still walked in the way he wanted them to. It was a religious, very religious community. Many of them struggled to make a living. Rabbinic positions did not pay very well in Poland. You had to struggle to make a living. And they were all blessed with large families. They had a lot of children. And so you had to raise them. My grandfather was also interested, when he arranged-- that he arranged most-- most of the marriages, certainly of his daughters. He arranged them. He looked for yihus, which meant someone who came from an important family, not necessarily a rich family, but a family of scholars, who himself was a scholar. One of my aunts married a man who was a scholar, who never made a living for her. He didn't know what it meant to work. He just sat and studied, and she ran a small business, which eked out a living for all of them. And I think my grandfather was blessed that some of his grandchildren, not all of them, some of his grandchildren really followed his way. Others did not. Some of them began to drift away and were no longer as religious as they were. And I suspect that it must have hurt my father-- my grandfather very much. It was interesting how he accepted my father and our life in Germany, which was not just a Hasidic life. And my grandfather wore a shtreimel, which is the fur hat, certainly on the holidays and the Sabbath. He wore the-- the kaftan and the white socks, certainly on Saturday and on the holidays. My grandmother died a long time ago, before I was born. So I never knew her, although my grandfather had remarried twice after that. But I do not really remember grandmothers. And this is why I don't talk about them. And he, uh-- "], ["living in Poland as a child", "The life, as I remember it as a child-- now my own life-- and this was not in Stanislaw. We left Stanislaw, and we moved to a city in Poland, which was Bielitz. We moved there, because my aunt from my mother's side was a wealthy woman, who had real estate, and who made an apartment available to us free of charge, which made it easier for my father, who did not practice the rabbinic when he lived in Poland, but wasn't in business, not a very good businessman, not a very successful businessman. In fact, his first enterprise, my mother had accumulated some money. When my mother was married, she was an orphan. So she had accumulated some money, which was the dowry that she brought to him. I understand, it was always a big dowry. My mother claims it was big. My father said it was not so big. But he ran it into the ground. I mean, he took it, and ran a business, and just-- it failed. INTERVIEWER: What kind of business? MEYER STRASSFELD: A gro-- a store, not grocery, um, dry goods. INTERVIEWER: What kind of businesses were people running on this compound, in order to keep body and soul together. MEYER STRASSFELD: I think there was a grocery store that one of my-- my aunts probably ran. I don't recall some of the other stores. But I remem-- I think she had a grocery store that was available. I th-- I remember somehow, but I don't think it was one of my relatives, there was a shoemaker. I think somebody else who lived in that area was a tailor. That's about the, um, the people that I remember. INTERVIEWER: Any farming? MEYER STRASSFELD: Not there, no. No, not there. Because this was a city. "], ["the Hasidic clothes", "INTERVIEWER: Can you explain for us the wearing of the apparel that your grandfather wore on the holidays? People are perplexed by this garb that we see today, often. MEYER STRASSFELD: Well, the Hasidic movement, per se, believed that they ought to dress differently from the society around them. So they would-- this was part of the Hasidic approach to Judaism. That was a requirement. To them, it became a very important requirement, to separate themselves not only religiously, not only that they couldn't eat with their neighbors, their non-Jewish neighbors, and they couldn't celebrate many other things with the non-Jewish neighbors, and not that their neighbors encouraged them to do that either. It was a very good arrangement, I think, as far as the society was concerned at that time. Both communities integrated only when they had to and were separate, deliberately, one from the other. So the wearing a kaftan, wearing a long gown, was important to look different. They would wear, of course, their payot. They didn't cut their beards. And also, they didn't cut their-- their-- the, uh, corners of-- of their head, again, to let it grow. To the Hasidic movement, this was very basic. To the other Orthodox Jews in the community, this was not as important, as long as they would cut it within Jewish law. No razor was used, but they used-- in those days, they used depilatories. Today, of course, we use electric shavers. Also black hats, you didn't wear any other kind of hat. It was a black hat, and you always had your kippah, or yarmulke, as they used to call it, underneath your hat. This was part of it. And so, this was part of the-- the outer garment that was very important. Plus, the, uh, the tallit katan, and the tzitzit, the fringes, that you see in Fiddler on the Roof, which is part of, uh, the-- the uniform, more or less, of the Jew. This was fine during the week. For the Sabbath, you had to dress still differently. And although some of the garments that they wore were no doubt taken from the Polish gentry, but as we did with many other things in Jewish life, we absorbed from the society around us certain things that we liked, we sanctified them, and we incorporated them into the structure of Jewish life. And so then, on the Sabbath, you didn't wear the plain kapoteh, which was a very plain cloth. But you wore zeiden kapoteh, which is a satin kind of thing. And the richer you were, the more satin it contained. And also, to change the hat gear, you wore the shtreimel, which was a fur hat. And again, there were different, different Hasidic groups, had different kinds of shtreimel. There were some who merely had pieces of fur, like tail. They had-- something I think that was requirements, at least seven of them. Again, your seven days of Sabbath, so you had your seven ones. Others did not had merely a fur hat, and that was more the Russian Hasidic group, had a fur hat, without the tail sticking out. So this was, again, it depended upon the Hasidic rabbis. The women, of course, had their hair always covered. They wore what is known as a sheitel, very similar to a-- what do-- what do you call it? INTERVIEWER: A wig. MEYER STRASSFELD: A wig. A wig. Some of Hasidic rabbis didn't even permit that. And what they called-- what they called a Stan tichel They used to wear a very lovely kind of bandana around their hair. Very often, some of them, the richer ones, would have it with some jewelry that would be attached to it, either fake jewelry or real jewelry. My grandmother-- my father always told me-- she never wore a sheitel. She wore a stan tichel So her hair was completely covered. That was the requirement. And that was part of the way in which they did it. "], ["Hebrew schools", "You started Hebrew school-- and I did start-- I started Hebrew school at age 3, before public school. We didn't know about public schools. That wasn't required yet. And when, you know-- it was required after. Because when-- when Poland became Poland again, after World War I, they began to introduce compulsory education. But before that, compulsory education was not required. And so I started Hebrew school at age three. And I remember yet-- and this is again, was very traditional to be done that way. My father would wear his tallit, his prayer shawl, and carried me on his shoulders to the rabbi, who would teach me. And they would put candy on top of the letters. And every time I learned a letter-- this was the first lesson though. I learned a letter, I would be given a candy. And of course, candy was a rarity, like many other things were rare. There was-- staple food was what we ate. We didn't know how to eat other food. My father always tells the story when he came to Germany, and they served him bananas, which he had never seen in his life. And he didn't know how to eat it. And so he didn't peel the banana, he bit right into it. Until he was told-- you know, oranges were-- were strange. You had oranges only when you were sick. Otherwise you didn't serve that. You couldn't afford it. And so I started Cheder. And I-- when I was five years old, I went to what already became a yeshiva. I walked. I still remember that. Because this-- these were the incidents when, very often, I was beaten or my payots were-- were pulled. I walked to a city, which was Biala, which was just across a bridge. And they had a yeshiva. And so I studied there. At age of six-- I was five and a half, six-- I already studied the Bible, the Chumash. Because you know, in two years, I learned completely how to pray. "], ["prayers", "I mean, prayer was-- it was obvious. You prayed as early as you could. Your parents prayed with you the minute you could recite words. The first thing that we learned was Shema Yisrael and Mode Ani. Uh, you know, and not some-- some rhymes. Because this is the way our society was built. "], ["non-Orthodox Jews", "That does not mean that there were-- I'm sort of painting a picture of only orthodoxy. There were many Jews who were not orthodox. Socialists. Jews who had rejected much of the teaching of the community, who wanted to become Poles, be very integrated with the Polish community. It didn't go as easily, because I think the anti-Semites didn't give us the opportunity to become involved in it. But there were others who simply said, no, we don't do this. So they didn't go to services every day, and they didn't observe as much. Naturally, being brought up in the kind of environment I was, I didn't meet many of them. But I do know that they exist. I know that they were here. I know that there were some Jews who were not Sabbath observers. The only difference is that in those communities, those who were not would hide it. It was not as it is reversed here. Here, the minority are sabbath observers. I mean, there, the minority were not sabbath observers. So those, let's say, you wanted to smoke, would hide somewhere in the bathroom and smoke. And no one saw it. But otherwise, they went along with some of the things. The holidays were such beautiful days that we celebrated together. "], ["meeting the Belz Rebbe", "I remember as a child on my way to the yeshiva, I see people running to the railroad station, which was near my house. And I see Jews are running at the railroad station. I says, where are you running? And they said that Belz Rebbe-- he was one of the great luminaries of the Hasidic movement-- was coming to town. And so everybody was going there. Well, I said, if they're going, I'm not going to go to school. So would I. And I went. And I still remember proudly telling my father that I shook hands with the Belz Rebbe, which was not easy. But I was so small, I stood between someone's legs, and I just put my hand through. And he was walking down-- people had made an aisle for him to go through, and he was shaking hands with everybody. And so I succeeded in doing that. And I'm sure that for weeks, I refused to wash that hand. I'm no-- I'm not a-- a Hassid. I somehow-- that I changed my upbringing, I think in Germany, brought about the change. And then when I came to the United States-- and I always used to tell this to my parents, who accepted it, as long as I was living a-- a Jewish life, a good Jewish life-- except that I told them that you probably saw great Hasidic rabbis. I did not see them. "], ["the Hasidic view of America", "And actually, until World War II, the great, outstanding rabbi-- Hasidic rabbis of Europe never thought of coming to America. America was the treyfe medinah. It was not a good place to come to. They were very worried. That was one of the problems, that my grandfather didn't come. We wanted to get him here. And being the great Cantor that he was, we were able to get him to come from Poland. That was ear-- you know, the early years yet. My grandfather, first of all, said, I'm not going to go without the children. And you have to take all the children. And that was not possible. We just didn't have enough affidavits to bring them. And as I said, the Polish quota was oversubscribed. It was very, very difficult. But my grandfather, he could have done it. And so he refused to come. The other thing that he also worried about, it was come to this country. This country was known to be a non-religious-- jewishly speaking-- a non-religious community. What was going to happen to him? "], ["a gift from grandfather for bar mitzva", "I remember, I was bah mitzvahed yet in Germany. And my grandfather sent me the pair of Tefillin. I didn't buy them in Germany. He bought them-- that was his gift to me. INTERVIEWER: He came to your bar mitz-- MEYER STRASSFELD: No, no, no. He didn't come. No, I guess we didn't have the funds, and he didn't have the funds. And who would have thought? We didn't think in those terms in those days. But he sent me the Tefillin. And with that was a note. He was hoping that I would use them every day. Because again, German Jewry did not have a reputation for being very observant, very religious. I fulfilled my grandfather's wish, because I haven't missed a day. "], ["the role of women in the Hasidic society", "INTERVIEWER: Rabbi, in this day and age, when people are conscious of the status of women, I thought you might comment on the role of women in the shtetl, or Polish society, Jewish society, and German society. MEYER STRASSFELD: The society was a patriarchal society. The women's role was certainly a minor one, in some respects. It certainly was a minor one community wise. Women were not involved in the community. They had no say in community, what the community was doing. The women's important role was really the home. She shaped the home. She was responsible for creating the kind of life. And she raised her children more than her husband-- husband did. Because the husband was-- really worked very hard. And it didn't matter what profession he was in, or what work he did. What business he was in. There was no such thing as nine to five situations. That didn't exist. You worked, and worked, and worked. And so it was the woman who really created the kind of life that was passed on. I know that my mother, may her soul rest in peace, shaped us much more than my dad. Much more. Any empathy, and compassion, and commitment to Judaism that I have, I got from my father theoretically and intellectually, but from my mother, I got it emotionally. And it was an emotional part that certainly has been much more important, and has maintained and inspired me and my two brothers in the same way. She created the Sabbath by preparing for the Sabbath meal, by baking her-- the challah, and preparing the meal, and doing all the things to make it as beautiful as she could. She's the one who had absolute faith, tremendous amount of faith, that we would get out. Because we had difficulty. You know, we were trying to leave, and yet none of the two possibilities showed up for a while. And she said, God is going to be with us. And she said this when we came to this country. And life was not easy in this country. We came to Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where my father was the Cantor and the Shochet. It was difficult to make a living in those days. There were three sons to be raised. And he wanted us to study in yeshiva. So we went. I only lived in Hazleton for less than a year. Uh, then I went to yeshiva in New York. I studied there. And my two brothers followed a little later, after they were bar mitzvahed, they came. And three-- three sons were away. And they couldn't visit us as frequently, because they didn't have the funds for it. And so, the women's role, to some extent, was in molding, I think, the overall community in the feeling that they had, the commitment that they had. Yes women, community wise, assumed certain responsibilities. There were certain organizations that were run almost exclusively by women. One was the committee for dowring brides. This was a very important, very basic committee. Because marriages usually needed the dowry that the wife-- the bride could bring. And they had to encourage that and make it possible. So this was-- this fund-- fundraising was going on. And that money was made available to the poor brides. They would dress them. They would make sure, at least, that she had a bridal gown and at least a few other things that would go as her trousseau. The fact-- especially if they were orphans-- women were involved in orphanages that existed throughout Poland, much more than men. Men didn't-- these were women functions, to a great extent. We did not have-- at least I do not remember-- anything similar to our ladies auxiliaries and sisterhoods of synagogues. I don't remember that in Poland. But I was too young to remember that, to have noticed it. But the other groups, I know. Those were the things that were very, very important. Because I know my mother was involved in it. This was very basic, as an involvement for them, to do what they can in their community. They tried to make the home as beautiful as possible. That doesn't mean that some of the men weren't tyrants. I'm sure that they were. I'm sure that they were very patriarchal, demanding things. You know, one of the things that you find Hasidim, if they walked with their wives, never walked next to them. The man always walked before, and the wife walked behind. That's how they set it up. For whatever reason, I don't know. But that's how they set it up. They never walked next to each other. The wife had an inferior role, no doubt about it. But I think she made up for it in the realm of spirit of Jewishness, which was exclusively hers, because the husband had very little input. "], ["the Hasidic mens' occupation", "INTERVIEWER: You said the husband worked. There was no such thing as nine to five. But you had also said that many of the men just simply were scholars, or-- so what was this work that kept them-- kept them busy 12, 15 hours a day. MEYER STRASSFELD: Well, no. Those who were scholars were scholars. And they-- and they just studied constantly. They studied constantly. If they wanted to be scholars, and they wanted to do it, and their whole life, their whole joy was in that. They would go to services early in the morning, probably come home for breakfast, return, and sit in groups, and study together. And the whole day was spent that way. And that went on and on. And the same thing even happened at night. My mother always tells me that I had a-- an uncle that was my father's brother, who was an outstanding scholar. And he became a scholar-- he was a young man. He became a scholar, because I was a very poor sleeper. So he would come to our house. At that time, he was not married. He would come to our house, and was so more or less babysitting. My parents went to sleep. But I didn't want to sleep. I was a very bad sleeper. So he would rock me. And he would sit and study. And of course, as he studied, he shook. And he had the-- the-- the, uh-- the carriage was tied with the gartl, which again, Hasidim wear out of separation-- to himself. But if he fell asleep, I would start crying. And so that way, he said that he was forced to keep on studying, because I didn't let him go to sleep. INTERVIEWER: You're saying then that the woman whose husband was a scholar was not only responsible for the home and the emotional-- MEYER STRASSFELD: Yeah. INTERVIEWER: --component-- MEYER STRASSFELD: Also for making a living. INTERVIEWER: So how did that work, in order to support many children and-- MEYER STRASSFELD: Well, apparently, they mana-- they did it. Again, I'm too young to remember the details. But I think they did it. They managed it, because two-- well, one of the things you have to realize, that a woman who was married to a scholar, that was more important than any diamonds and any jewelry that she had. She was known as talmud hakham's wife, you know. The scholar's wife. She wasn't known by her own name. Probably they didn't even know her-- they didn't even know her family name, because that wasn't-- that didn't count. But talmud hakham, who had a seat up front in the synagogue. You see, even the synagogue, you had a certain amount of status. So the scholars were up front. They sat at what was known as the eastern wall, the mizrach wall. And then lesser and lesser people sat in the back. You had the-- you must also remember that you had such a separation in some communities, where the-- the artisans had their own synagogues, would not even mix with the business people, because they were less learned. INTERVIEWER: OK. "], ["the Hasidic community structure", "In the last five minutes that we have, rabbi-- this is fascinating. Can you describe this community structure that you're just beginning to touch on, division of scholars from artisans, from whatever. MEYER STRASSFELD: There were synagogues known as the shoemaker's synagogue or the tailor's synagogue. And people who were in that profession went to that synagogue. It was their synagogue. They were able to handle things easier, because then they were not challenged in any way as to knowledge. They ran the things as they understood it best. Such synagogues, for example, would not have a group that studied Talmud. But they would have a group that recited the psalms. Because that, everyone could do, even if you didn't understand what you were doing. Some of them were a little more learned. Then you would study the Chumash, the Bible, with translation, translation into Yiddish. So that each one was fulfilling his own way, in spite of the fact there was not-- that this was a structure that the overall society has established for them. And they were guided by it. It was not a happy time, let's say, for a marriage between the son of a shoemaker and the daughter of a scholar. It didn't happen too often. And if it did, you know, Jewish literature writes about this and describes all kinds of problems that arose as a result of it. Because people didn't. This was one of the-- the fact was, this was one of the things that the Hasidic movement changed. Before the Hasidic movement, these divisions were very strong and were not bridged too often. When the Hasidic movement began, it said, nothing doing. Every Jew was alike, whether he's scholar or not. As much as we admire scholarship, not everyone can make it. And therefore, you have to build up the other Jew who felt inferior, because he was not the scholar. See, scholarship was always admired. And I think we have then transposed Jewish scholarship into general scholarship. That's why Jews have always looked for scholarship as the epitome of life. So this was part of that. The, relationships I don't remember much of that. But mainly from what I've read and I've heard, these separations existed and were very often maintained. Except where the Hasidic groups moved in, and they sort of did away with it already. "], ["different types of Jewish community in Poland", "MEYER STRASSFELD: Three and a half million Jews in Poland. Was this the general lifestyle of those three and a half million people, or was this a very special group? MEYER STRASSFELD: No. I-- I would think that to some extent, the overall lifestyle of Polish Jewry was admMEYERtion of scholarship. And therefore, scholars were probably put into a special category. Then the businessmen, and you had a lot of very successful business people. You know, all the mills and large textiles, and large-- there were all run by Jews. Then the Warsaw-- overall, the Warsaw community, which I'm sure represented all kinds of Jews. Enlightened Jews, religious Jews, non-religious Jews, socialists. And they all had their own-- their own organizations and their-- their own get togethers. And yet, the overall spirit, however, I always think of Polish Jewry was a religious one. I think the religious community was probably the majority in Poland, not the other way around. The religious community was successful in electing representatives to the Polish parliament. So was the non-religious comm-- the Zionists-- now, for example, Zionism was frowned upon by this community completely. Whether religious Zionism or-- or Zionism, per se, that was frowned upon. But I remember, I had a few cousins who are Zionists. And their family was not very happy with that, because that already was a sign that they were not as religious. Which was true, but that's what they looked at. "], ["the ending, concluding words about the lost culture", "INTERVIEWER: In conclusion, about this culture that is no more. MEYER STRASSFELD: I don't think we-- we can recapture that culture. We can recapture some of the the themes, the goals of the culture, such as education, such as commitment to Judaism, such as a desire to ensure the continuity of the state of Israel. But none of us-- I, uh, I shouldn't say none. Few of us want to go back into a ghetto kind of set up, with the exception of a few Hasidic groups that you have in-- in-- in New York, who have created their own ghettos and feel most comfortable in that way. Because they feel completely threatened by the outside world. I think today, the majority of Jews, including orthodoxy, certainly want to live in the two worlds, the Jewish world and the general world, the culture. Where the cultures do not conflict, we can be together. Where there's a conflict, I think we have to be able to say, this I do not accept. This is not for me. And that's the only way, I think, we can continue building upon the culture that was. But I don't think is fit for the twentieth or twenty-first century anymore. INTERVIEWER: Rabbi, thank you.

I knew there was antisemitism in Czechoslovakia, but it never hit us, and if it did, we were always able to defend ourselves just like here. When I came to this country, democracy was nothing new to me, because I was used to it. I come from an upper class-- upper middle class family where there were two emphases-- education and love for the family.

My sister did not. She went to gymnasium. She got married when she was 20 years old. Lived in Slovakia in a town, Vranov nad Toplou. Married a rather intelligent person.

And, uh, times became hard because, um, Hitler became more powerful, and it disturbed our beautiful life. We didn't know from one day to the other what's going to happen. The family was very strong, and, uh, it was just unthinkable-- absolutely unthinkable that somebody or some power would be able to unroot us because this was the first law in our family-- the loyalty to the family. And so in 1938, when Czechoslovakia had to, um, give back the Sudetenland to the Germans, this was a tremendous blow to all of us, especially to the Jewish people. My youngest brother was in the army then-- in the Czech army at the, uh, German-Czech border. And I recall as a young girl when he called, was crying, and told my father that, uh, now he has to come home. All the soldiers have to come home because there won't be the fights. And my father said, don't come home. We don't know what the future will bring. Go to Bratislava-- which was the capital of Slovakia-- and make sure that you can go illegally to Israel, because this is where we are going to go. And we never heard of him for six, seven months.

My sister, who lived in Slovakia, at this point she lived in a different country. The Slovaks never liked Jews. Never. And they became quislings to the Germans, and the first thing that they have done was that they took Jewish children and deported them to Auschwitz or wherever. We never knew where.

They had been told not to make faces. She brought them into a store. I picked them up. They had been paid a great deal of money for that by my brother-in-law. I took the boys to a toilet, and I had already clothes for them. I dressed them up as nice little boys and, uh, took them home by train. The problem was that my nephew spoke only Slovak and not Hungarian, and my-- I was afraid. If they speak only Slovak, if somebody asks them a question and won't speak Hungarian, everybody will knew that these are foreigners. But anyhow, we were very lucky. We brought them home, and these boys lived with us for one whole year illegally in our house in the bathroom. Each time the, um-- somebody rang the bell we took them to the bathroom so that nobody knows. Otherwise my father would have been shot. I was their s-- school teacher. I taught them everything from geography to, uh, mathematics, grammar. I finished my gymnasium by that time and my matura. And I was-- I loved them as a mother. They have never been out for one year-- only in the courtyard. And by this time, the family couldn't take it after a year. We couldn't take it anymore. And, um, the Hungarian government knew that there were thousands of Jewish children like that in Hungary, and they, uh, came out with a very good-- I don't know whether it was a law. I don't remember. I was very young. But I had to take these two boys to Budapest, and, uh, they were arrested for a week. And we have paid thousands of dollars to get them out free.

This is my background, and, uh, have to be cultured. Had to-- had to know how to entertain a man. And, uh, that was nothing to be ashamed of. My father was a very religious Orthodox Jew. My mother was not, but she was very strict. So I had a very religious father and a very strict mother-- almost Victorian. My father was the most charitable person I have ever met with a marvelous sense of humor and understanding for his children. None of his children were religious, and he understood us. In a way, we were revolutionaries in his eyes, I'm sure. But he loved us dearly, and he knew that, in principle, we are with him. My mother didn't care that much for her religion, but being a dutiful person, a dutiful wife, she had to go to the temple, too, three or four times yearly. My father was very, um, respected in town. In fact, I, um-- I was very proud of being my-- the daughter of my father. That was an accomplishment. Women did not accomplish their own in my days. It was what family one comes from. And, uh, sometimes I miss it. "], ["under the Germans", "Of course, little by little, as the Germans came in, our lives had deteriorated. We were scared. We didn't go out. My father was afraid to go out. So they always sent me, because I was the only one-- at-- at this point, I was the only one at home. And I remember at 6 o'clock in the morning going and standing in line for bread and for sugar. And I came home at 10 o'clock. "], ["attempting to immigrate to the USA", "And then we had the idea that maybe-- I had an uncle in New York, my father's youngest brother. Maybe we should ask for a visa, an affidavit my uncle had sent to us. And I used to stand at the American consulate sometimes like 8 to 10 hours. Had we gotten a visa, we would have all been saved and made good citizens in this country. "], ["getting informed about being sent away to Germany", "And so the day came. We had, uh, terrible days of fear that each time a German soldier has gotten drunk he might knock on the door, and you have to open the door, but it didn't happen. They-- they broke windows. They broke doors, but from physical harm, we were spared. Um, one day my father came home and said, uh, we just had a, uh-- a, uh-- a conference with one of the German office-- SS officers. And he told us, and within three days we have to leave this town, and we have to go into a brick factory. And we are going to be leaving for Germany. And my father had still-- his mother was 89 years old or 90 years old. My father, being a very clever person, said to him, uh, I can understand that you are going to take us to work. I'm 62 years old. I still can work. My daughter can work. My wife can work, but what do you want from my mother? How can she work? She is a sick woman. Why do you tell me you are going to take her to Germany? He was-- the German was clever, too. He said, you know, from our experience, um, we know that families-- the young will work much better if the families are there. We know you Jews. You stick together, and if you know the grandmother or grandfather is there, you'll work much better and much harder. I don't think my father has ever believed it-- never-- but he never talked about it, and in three days we had to leave everything that my father worked for 36 years. And that's no tragedy. Trust me. That's no tragedy, because you can build up a new empire for yourself. It is that this was the last time that our family was together. And my sister had two children. "], ["in the brick factory", "My brother-in-law, my mother, my father, and I moved into the, um-- to that big factory, and we stayed there for two weeks-- lived like animals-- really like animals. INTERVIEWER 2: Where was the brick factory? EDITH PRAKIN: It was about five miles outside of our town. "], ["living conditions in the brick factory", "INTERVIEWER 2: Describe the living conditions. EDITH PRAKIN: Well, I will tell you that, in one room like this-- is it 15 by 15? Maybe 30 people lived. If one slept, one has to-- stood up, stand up. And how we took it, I don't know. I do not know. "], ["family", "INTERVIEWER 2: Were the boys with you? EDITH PRAKIN: The two boys were with us. My brothers were not. They lived in different towns, so they had been picked up in different towns. We did not know. We could not correspond by this time. And, uh, we had no telephone by this time. They took every old-- uh, all the licenses from Jews. They were not able to work. All the businesses were closed. "], ["getting help from the Greek Catholic Church", "And, uh, I must say that the Greek Catholic church, which had-- the bishop of the Greek Catholic church, uh, lived in our town, and my father went to ask him for help because nobody worked, and yet you had to buy bread. And they supported us-- not us, personally, but the Jews. They did. I will have to say that. They gave money to the Jews. I don't know whether the Germans knew about it or not. And this was that Greek Catholic bishop-- Orthodox. "], ["in the brick factory", "You know the Orth-- and, um, so after three-- or two weeks, we have been deported. We have been taken to the station. INTERVIEWER 2: Did you work in the brick factory? EDITH PRAKIN: No. It was not-- it was-- nobody-- uh, the brick factory I think belonged to-- to a Jewish concern, so it-- we just lived there in little huts. And this was just a transition to get them out from their own homes, put them into the brick factory, which was near the railroad station. "], ["on the train", "And then they took us from the brick factory to the railroad station. 90 people in each box. Nine-- INTERVIEWER 2: What year was this? EDITH PRAKIN: This was nine-- June, 1944. We didn't know where. We had-- each of us had just a little bundle with food. That's what they told us to take. INTERVIEWER 2: 90 people. Would you talk-- EDITH PRAKIN: 9, 0 children, old people, young ones. It was hot. There was no air. I still see my mother sitting there in the corner with my sister, they're going-- they say, I'm so warm. I'm so hot. I have no air. And today, I couldn't understand it. Maybe I wasn't that warm. But I-- today I understand what she went through, not only because there was no air, but the anguish-- what has happened to her six children. And maybe that's what made her choke. So there is a mother I can understand. And my father did not speak for three days. But my sister-- before we arrived to Auschwitz, I remember when my sister told him, father, we have always been a very God loving people. How come that God has forsake us? I remember that very vividly. And she, in her anguish. And my father said, you know, we have forsaked him before, and I'm so happy about that-- that I heard it-- because my father was such a devout religious man that he believed, really, that he left God before God has left him-- that he went and died not in the vain, maybe. I don't know. And before we arrived to Auschwitz-- maybe a few miles. "], ["father talking to the family before arriving", "We-- we were in Auschwitz. We didn't know where we were. I never heard of Auschwitz. We just saw people running around like mad-- mad people. No hair and so-- clothes with-- with striped-- and I said to my father, you know, maybe we are going to survive. Look, there are people running around. Maybe they are workers. And my father said to me, look, my family. He said, uh, I think we have arrived. And there's one thing I-- I want to tell you. Whoever survives, you've got to go and work right away. Sell your knowledge. Go to work. Keep your sanity. And keep the principles that you have been taught. That was his last words I heard. And we came off. We were so happy to have some fresh air. "], ["on the train", "INTERVIEWER 1: How long had the trip taken? EDITH PRAKIN: I don't know. Maybe an eternity. Maybe only two days, maybe only 24 hours, maybe just six hours-- I do not know, but it seemed an eternity. I have-- INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember-- do you remember the box car? Do you remember other people? Did you talk to people? EDITH PRAKIN: Nobody talked. Nobody talked. INTERVIEWER 2: Did people cry? EDITH PRAKIN: We-- we just looked at one another. I remember I was full of life, a young girl, and I said, what's going to happen to me? I'm just starting. I'm just starting to blossom? I understood that. What's going to happen to me? And I just looked around. I didn't cry. Never. And I-- I think that, um, that also has strengthened my-- my feeling toward the Jewish people, because I saw them as animals. When you are hungry, you are like an animal because that pains you terribly, and yet they were not animals. Never. So we arrived. Before we arrived-- INTERVIEWER 2: I-- I want to know. In the box car, however many hours, there must have been humiliations. EDITH PRAKIN: Terrible. There was terrible humiliation, because if it was 6 hours, or 10 hours, or three days, I do not know. In some ways, one has to relieve oneself, and it happened. Nobody has ever said a word. I know it for sure that there was near me a young man, maybe 35-- I never saw him. And he must have been in tremendous distress maybe after 24 hours. He couldn't get up and go somewhere. He just had to do his business wherever-- near me. I never felt that he was repulsive or did something wrong. And I'm sure he didn't feel-- if I have done it, I don't recall. It was so natural that we just are together, and we are going to suffer it out together. Nobody hated anybody. We were just wondering, what has happened to us? How come? Why don't we do something about it? It was impossible. "], ["the precision of the Germans", "It was done with such precision and so fast that the computer is nothing. A computer is baby stuff. The way the Germans have done that-- it was so well done, with such precision-- trust me, a computer could never do it. It would make a mistake. They didn't. It was thought out, and with their precision and, uh-- their compulsiveness. They have done-- from their point of you, had done a good job. One thing they have not done-- they did not kill our spirit. The more they hate us, the more proud I was. "], ["arriving to Auschwitz", "INTERVIEWER 2: What happened when you got to the place? To Auschwitz? EDITH PRAKIN: Well, we got off. I didn't even get a chance-- sometimes that bothers me. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to my mother. I should have said something, but I didn't, because I thought we would be together. And there were about 10 officers-- German officers that said go left, go right, go left, go right. And all of a sudden I-- I found myself to the right with, uh, 5,000 other women. Everything happened so fast. I don't even know how I was walking, and I found myself in a big room. And they were already shaving off my-- my head, and they gave me some clothes. I remember I had a long black skirt with white stripe, which was at least, uh, three sizes too large and a shocking yellow blouse. No shoes. That's all. And then they told us to go-- to stand appell I think five women or four women stood-- or maybe 2,000 women. And they took us to a block, they called it. That was our housing. And I was in block 23. We were, I think, about 2,000, 3,000 women there. There were these, um-- how you call it? These beds, um-- INTERVIEWER 2: Bunks. EDITH PRAKIN: Bunks. And I think six of us were sleeping on a bunk. "], ["the hunger", "By this time, I suppose that nature takes care of it. You don't think. You don't ask yourself where you are. The only thing that you can think of is that you are hungry. And they don't give you anything to eat. You don't ask yourself where your mother is, where your sister is. You just want to take care of yourself at this point. I stayed in block 23 I think for about five, six days. Maybe I ate once. And don't ask me how we looked. "], ["thoughts after a few days in Auschwitz", "And, uh, one day I was standing near the block. I think it was about five or six days after I arrived. And, uh, many a times I look at my dog, and I think, what is he thinking of? Is he happy? Is he content? Does he know who I am? Does he think at all? And I think this is the way I must have been. You don't think. I was-- one just-- everything is closed. Where am I? I never heard the name Auschwitz. I didn't even know I was in Auschwitz. I knew-- I didn't know what a concentration camp was, and I thought maybe this is it, or maybe in five days they will take us to work. "], ["meeting sister-in-law", "It's-- and I remember I was standing there for about-- after five or six days that we arrived, and somebody pats me on the shoulder, and I look at her, and I burst into crying. It was my sister-in-law. There were one million women. There were about 35 blocks. There were one million women-- looked all alike. No hair, some of them naked-- and my sister-in-law says hello to me. She says I'm in block 16. We arrived three days ago, and I have my three sisters with me. You are going to come and live with us. Of course. Without question. "], ["deciding to stay alive", "And after three days, I heard that block 23 has been sent to the crematorium, and from that day on, I knew I'm a survivor. I knew it no matter what is going to happen to me, and no matter how much I'm going to start, or they will hit me, or whatever, I am going to survive and tell the story one day. And I did. In some miraculous way, I always survived. Sometimes I say to my children not by my intelligence, maybe by my healthy instinct, I do not know. And I was there with my sister-in-law in block 16. I don't remember how long-- maybe six months, maybe seven months. And this was the best part, because they, uh, really just keep you to die or to wait to go to the crematorium. "], ["being hit by a German", "And have to tell you an episode, which I told Eva last night. I had terrible dysentery after a few months naturally. I maybe were 80, 90 pounds. Food was terrible. And, uh, I had to go to the bathroom. And there was still some humanity in me. I was embarrassed in the block, so I said I'll go to the latrine. Who cares? But there was a Blocksperre as they said. Their camp was closed. It was like a curfew because two prisoners were missing. Who knows? Maybe they committed suicide. We don't know. So I went. I figured I'll take that chance. And I-- when I came out, a German Aufseherin, a very famous one-- and I'm not proud of it-- Irma Grese-- INTERVIEWER 2: Her name? EDITH PRAKIN: Confront-- Irma Grese is her name. She was the devil, the bestial devil of Auschwitz. She was beautiful-- absolutely beautiful blonde woman, impeccably dressed with high, shiny boots. And she confronted me, and she says, you know that there is a curfew. What are you doing here? And I said, I'm sorry. I have dysentery. I just had to go. I have terrible cramps. She says, turn around. And I did. And she always had that-- INTERVIEWER 1: Riding crop. EDITH PRAKIN: You know, that Peitsche How you call it? INTERVIEWER 1: Riding crop. EDITH PRAKIN: That. And she hit me about 10 times on my back. INTERVIEWER 2: This is a-- with a whip? EDITH PRAKIN: With a whip. And she said, now you go back. I didn't cry. I did not cry. The humiliation pained me terribly. Not the physical-- one can survive physical pain, but how does one survive emotional pain? And I went back to the block. And little did I realize I was bleeding. And my sister-in-law said, you are bleeding. What has happened to you? I said, uh, nothing. She said, now you tell the truth. I said, oh, I fell down. In the meantime, my back, of course, blew up. So I had to tell her the story. And of course, uh, she started to cry and so on. It healed after three or four days. I'm a young person. I was a young and healthy person, so it healed. But it never healed my soul that I have been hit, I have been humiliated this way. And humiliated in front of my family, too, that I have been whipped. And yet, I recall very vividly that, as I walked back, I said to myself, I'm innocent. I'm even more noble than she is. INTERVIEWER 2: How did you manage the dysentery after the beating? And how did you know this person's name? EDITH PRAKIN: I didn't. We didn't know her person-- when I was liberated, she came to trial, and then I realized that I had the honor to be whipped by Irma Grese. And we all knew her, because she was absolutely beautiful, but a psychopath. "], ["Edith's view of the Germans", "I think Germany has connected all the psychopaths, and, uh-- and the sadistic element of their people, because no human being in his right mind with healthy instinct could have done what they have done to us. I also want to say, don't ever believe that the Germans did not know about it. I'm witness of it. They took us from Auschwitz one day into town of Auschwitz-- about 5,000 women. There was an epidemic, so they took us to-- to take certain baths, because of course, if there is an epidemic, they might get it too. And I can tell you that men and women came out from their homes, and I can recognize that woman today who came out with her-- with her apron, and she was still drying her hands and had a smile on her face just to look at us, how silly how stupid, and how ugly we look. And she knew it that we were innocent prisoners. All of them knew it, and they never had the guts to do something about it. Never. INTERVIEWER 2: Did they talk to you? EDITH PRAKIN: Never. I had an opportunity to talk only when I have been taken away from Auschwitz. I was very lucky. "], ["leaving Auschwitz", "One day the great Mengele physician came, and, uh, also left and right, left and right. And, uh, they took about 3,000 women to a town in northern Germany-- Salzwedel They gave us different clothes-- a dress. That's all-- a half a bread. And I have to de-- describe this because it's something very unusual-- half a bread and a piece of margarine. We did not know how long we are-- where we go, what they are going to do with us, but we figure out, if they give us bread and margarine, they take us somewhere where we are going to live. They don't take us to the crematorium, but how long we are going to be away we did not know. And it's very interesting how the human inventiveness works-- or the human survival. None of us ate the first two days-- or maybe the first 24 hours. We were terribly hungry-- terribly. And I will never be-- I wish I will be-- maybe one has to be poetic or whatever to describe what hunger is all about. It pains like nothing on earth, and we were very hungry, but we did not eat the bread maybe for 24 hours, maybe for 36 hours. I do not recall how long we were in-- in those box cars. Only the last day because we couldn't take it. We started to eat the bread. And it's interesting. We all made a big hole in that half bread-- just a big hole-- and we put the margarine in. Nobody told anybody what to do, but all of us had done the right thing-- the same thing. They gave us one piece of bread-- no paper-- just one piece of bread in one hand and a piece of marg-- small piece of pan margarine in the other, and go. And we went into this box car, and I said to myself, how am I going to hold it? So I made the big hole. I put the margarine in, and I covered the margarine with the bread-- the-- the piece of bread that I took out. And my friend did that, and my sister-in-law did that. She didn't ask me what to do. And the other-- we had about 15 to 20, maybe 30 cars. I do not know. We all have done the same thing. We all came to the same conclusion. Don't eat it right away, because you might be on-- on five days, and then you are going to starve four days. Keep it as long as you can, and this is what we have done. And there's one episode that I would like to tell you. "], ["on the train", "I don't know how long we have been in those box cars, but it was dark. I still hear it-- the-- I still hear the, um-- the train-- tum, tum, tum, tum. Nobody said a word. We were just wondering, where are they going to take us? One morning-- I think it was morning or early afternoon. I don't know. We arrived, and that-- the train stopped there for an hour. Why? We don't know. And a friend of mine said, why don't you stand up. There was just a little window with bars-- and see. I said, I can't. I don't have enough energy to climb up. She says, I'm going to sit down, and now you stand on my shoulders. And I did. And I looked out, and I saw paradise. The sun was bright and vivid. There was cleanliness all over. It was a station somewhere in Germany. There were three or four people there-- one woman with a child nicely dressed up. A child was crying. People-- people were people, not animals. And I saw thought, paradise must look like this. I have-- I have forgot already how normal people look like, how they act, how they speak, how they dress. I saw the sun in Auschwitz. I saw the sun come up, because we have to get up 4:00 in the morning, but it never was beautiful to me. Never. I n-- I never saw it shine. It was just the beginning of a horrible day, and in the evening, the end of what. And-- but here there was life, and I-- and I had such yearning. I still feel it in my bones. I had such yearning to live, to run, to just run away and never come back. To run to the end, where there is no way back. And when I told the girls-- I said, girls, you have no idea how beautiful the sun is, and I saw a baby was crying, and a woman was kissing that baby. Is there such a thing as love? And my sister-in-law at this point lost two children. Her-- one was six years old, and one was one-year-old. The boy's name was Eli, and the little girl was named Dina. And she knew she lost them. And she started to cry terribly. I was sorry I have ever said it. And you have-- we left, and about next day a German officer came in and said, who can cook? So with-- nobody wants to volunteer. He said, I need two cooks. And my sister-in-law said, well, how about volunteering? At least we won't starve. And I said, I'm scared. I'm scared to volunteer. Maybe that's-- maybe they-- they're fooling us. He said, I am serious. I need two cooks. So we volunteered. "], ["working as a cook", "And about three, four hours later, we arrived to a town-- Salzwedel-- which had a big munition factory and a sugar factory. And as soon as we arrived, they put me to the kitchen. That was very nice, because there was food there. And I cooked for-- I think it was for 60 SS men and women. Those were the so-called, uh, SS men who took care of us-- of the prisoners. And, uh, every morning at 3:30 they woke me up. At 4 o'clock I was in the kitchen already, had to make coffee, breakfast, because at 5 o'clock, the prisoners have left for the munition factory. I worked in the munition factory for three days-- the first three days, and then they took me up, and maybe I cook too well. I don't know. And, um, I stayed there until my liberation. I had two bosses-- one SS man from Braunschweig, and one SS woman from Salzwedel. The woman wasn't bad. At least she asked me who I am. They never asked us anything. Never communicated with us, and, um, uh, it's the first time-- I-- I spoke German. It's the first time that somebody has asked me, who are you? Why are you here? And I told her. I figured, what can they do to me? So she'll kill me. By this time, really, life was very cheap. And the man was very harsh-- very harsh. The first day I came there I was very hungry, and I saw some cabbage. He told me to peel potatoes. So I peel the potatoes while he was there. I was terribly hungry, so while I-- I was peeling the potatoes, I ate the peels. And he ripped me on my eye. He says, I don't want you to do that. You peel the potatoes, and the peels will be thrown away. So I thought, well, he's not always going to be in the kitchen. If he wants me to work-- I-- by this time, I started to be rational. I was figuring out things. If they wanted to work, they have to give me to eat, because that's the only-- that was the only way to survival. If you have something to eat, you're going to survive, unless they kill you. "], ["gaining weight during the time working at the kitchen", "I started to gain weight. Of course, we did not menstruate at all. And I started to gain weight. I was up to maybe 85 pounds in Auschwitz, and, of course, I had more to eat here. And, uh, I gained-- who knows-- 20 pounds. And, uh, I wasn't heavy. I was puffed up. My face was puffed up. And in Salzwedel, I have, um-- became my self again. Myself, if I would like to explain that-- that I have remembered home. I remembered my father, my mother, my family, and I want to conduct myself so that they are proud of me. "], ["communicating with God", "And, um, I became very religious in a sense that I communicated with God. Every morning, at 3:30, when I came into this kitchen, I had 10 minutes talk with God-- not from fear. I never talked to him as a second class citizen. I demanded it. I demanded-- what he has done to his people, and I demanded to be liberated, because I want to live. I wanted it so badly that I would turn on everything. And every time I finished talking, I knew he answered me. You are going to be liberated. But of course, hard times came always-- every day something new. And, uh, I don't recall really how long I was in Salzwedel, but life was better because it no longer was a Vernichtungslager or a, uh-- a-- INTERVIEWER 1: Extermination-- EDITH PRAKIN: Extermination camp. It was a working camp, so conditions were better. "], ["working as a laundry lady", "One day, two French prisoners arrived to the camp. They were POWs who worked in the mun-- sugar factory in Salzwedel. And we saw men-- beautiful-- two young man, and I said to my sister-in-law, you know, I think I'm alive. I haven't thought-- for a year, I haven't thought man, woman, sex, to be in love. It's the first time I saw a decent man. And I thought he-- believe me, he was not as handsome fellow. I'm sure he wasn't, but I thought he was an Adonis. You are the most beautiful person on earth. They came to ask the commandant whether they could give us some food that they have received from the Red Cross, and the commandant said no. But I must say that our commandant, who was not an SS man-- I know his name-- Schrader. He came from Braunschweig, he told us, and he was in the regular army. He was not-- he was a man with some compassion, and I will tell you that I know it personally-- from personal experience, more so than the other prisoners. One day he came into the kitchen and said I need a laundry lady. I need somebody to do my wife's laundry. Would you give me her? Sure. So I went to his house. They took me in the car, and they took me down to the cellar. And this is where Europeans do the laundry, and there were about 15 sheets. I don't know if-- in Europe, one washes laundry once in four weeks, so it accumulates. And, uh, he told me I have to wash. So, you know, you have to whatever you call it, and I washed. I did the laundry. I boiled it-- whatever. I knew that-- I had been taught at home-- we didn't do it at home, but I knew how it was done. And it took maybe from 8:00 in the morning till about 7:00 in the evening, and then they brought me up to the kitchen and gave me something to eat, just like my mother did with her laundry lady. And, uh, he said to me, where do you come from? Are you, sind sie eine Judin? Are you Jewish? Yes. Where do you come from? Czechoslovakia. He said to me, why did you have to be a, uh-- a paratrooper? Why? I said, I'm a paratrooper? I said, excuse me. Why do you say that? He said, well, you are here because you were a paratrooper. I said, I don't even know how somebody-- a paratrooper? I said, I'm here for one reason-- that I have been born Jewish. He said, what family do you come from? And I tell him. He said, I can't believe it that you are here just because you are-- I said, yes. You better believe it. And he-- he looked at his wife. And they were people of 60s. And so he gave me some wienerschnitzel there and whatever, you know. And he took me back. EDITH PRAKINS.: You mean in a-- INTERVIEWER 2: You were talking in Salzwedel or whatever.

And, uh, we knew, by this time-- it was bombed by the Americans-- and we knew that the Americans must have known that there were prisoners there, because the fact that it was bombed but our quarters were not, which was very near to it. And, uh, one day-- I just have to laugh about it today, how compulsive the Germans are-- the fact that it was bombed and all the windows in the-- in that SS kitchen was broken. Within-- would you believe that within half an hour, those windows were fixed? They are so compulsive. And next day, the Americans came and bombed again, but they always fixed it. They didn't leave it. It had to be-- they are that compulsive. "], ["before liberation", "Anyhow, I just want to tell you about my liberation, which is a very beautiful story. Uh, we heard cannons-- if I can call it cannons-- but we did not know what was going on. And, uh, one day, this Kommandant came-- said, Appell! It's an emergency. Appell! \" Appell\" means that everybody goes out and stands in-- like soldiers. And he said, the enemy is near. I got orders from headquarters in Hamburg that I am supposed to burn this Lager with five liters of gasoline. Now, if you all sign it that I was a good man, you will be saved. Now, who wouldn't sign it? So we all signed it. Frankly, he was not a bad man. We had no contact with him. And maybe at the-- at the last analysis, at the last minute he had-- his conscience bothered him. He didn't kill us. He let us be liberated. But my boss, he was not that merciful. That morning-- it was the 14th of April, 1945. Early in the morning, evidently the Americans broke through, and broke the water lines, and we had no water. And he wanted to shave or needed water, and he said to me, come here, Edith. You are going to go with this Offizierin with two pails, and one mile-- or one kilometer-- you are going to bring some water from a well. We need water. So I did. And when I came back-- the water was very heavy. Two pails of water. So I just put it down. So she slapped me. This woman knew that it-- it's only minutes, only hours, that the Americans-- that their enemy will be-- but she still had the control over me. She slapped me. She says, don't you dare put this down. Let's go fast. So I did, and I brought in the water. And, uh, he came to me, and he said, well, you know I was a good boss to you, wasn't I? Oh, sure. Oh! How else? Of course. And so, you see? You survived the armies. He called the Americans \"armies.\" I know the armies are here, he said, and within one hour, they they're going to be-- and I'm going to stay here. He did, because there was nowhere for them to go, not because he was so brave. Because as soon as he saw the first American, he started to run. And that first American has killed him. He was the first one to be killed. "], ["liberation", "Anyhow, it was about 10 o'clock in the morning. We heard lots of commotion all over. There was tremendous pressure all over the-- the gates were closed. And I want to emphasize that Salzwedel did not have only Jewish prisoners. We had been with lots of Danish and Dutch prisoners, and Gypsies. And, um, the gates were closed, and everybody was standing in the yard like one man. And about 11 o'clock, we heard a tank stopping at the gate, and two shots fired, and the gates opened. And as we ran, there was a white and a black American standing side-by-side in the tank. That's the first time I saw a black man. I loved him for it all my life. And he stood that erect, maybe because he understood. And the boss was running, and he shot him. I still see him lying there with his beautiful, shiny boots that I was shining an hour before. And I had no pity on him. And we were liberated. He said, everybody goes. And everybody went crazy-- crazy! And there was a milk factory-- uh, not a factory, but a, uh, a Molkerei INTERVIEWER 2: A dairy. EDITH PRAKINS.: A dairy. And we ran to the dairy, and we ate so much we all got sick. "], ["thoughts after liberation", "And I recall, the same afternoon, I sat down on a big stone, and I said, wh-- what's now? What's going to happen to us now? We are all free. And we're really free. Where's the family? I'm a young person with a sheltered, innocent life, and what am I going to do now? Who's going to take care of me? And it's just came back like an echo to me. Keep all your principles that you brought from home. Go and work. Sell your knowledge. I did. "], ["work", "I worked two weeks later. I spoke German and English. For some crazy reason, I took English in school, in the Gymnasium. In the [INAUDIBLE] Gymnasium. When you're 13 years old, everybody took French and Latin, and I wanted to take English. And my-- my mother did not think it was elegant enough. You've got to learn French! No, I said, I want to learn English. Why? I don't know. I want to learn English. And I spoke English well enough that I became an interpreter. German, because my-- German was my second mother tongue, uh, and English. And years later, I have realized that maybe nothing has happened just by accident. Maybe I had to learn English to survive afterwards, so that I got a good job, a respectable job, that I had the respect for myself. And I did what I was supposed to do, not sponge around after I was liberated, but go and work and do something with your life and look ahead. And I did. "], ["building a family after the war", "I'm among the very lucky ones, because I have met a marvelous man that I live with 33 years who loves me exactly for what I am, by knowing me very well, and loves me also for my-- all my shortcomings. And I have three wonderful daughters, and we are very close. INTERVIEWER 2: Was your husband from Europe? Is your husband-- EDITH PRAKINS.: No, my husband is a native American, and sometimes I feel that it's very-- it's very difficult for him vis-a-vis me, because he feels the pain, and he almost feels, um, guilty that he has not gone through what I did. And I am very thankful to him that he hasn't. "], ["starting a new life after the war", "And, uh, I'm thankful also-- huh. I don't know what I should thank for that. Maybe I went in with a healthy mind, and also came out with a healthy mind-- that I was able to, um, put the pieces together after we had been really uprooted. It's difficult to start when you don't have a past, when you cannot prove who your mother and father was, where you went to school, what you wore. Who were your friends? How did you behave? What are you proud of, and what can you be ashamed of? You can never prove it. People have to know you, just what you are today. And, uh, I have accom-- I think I have accomplished. I'm proud of myself, that I have accomplished a great deal. And, of course, my husband was tremendously, uh, instrumental in this, with his infinite patience. And mostly, he's the most loyal person that I have ever met, the most loyal. And with love, of course. Love can do mira-- miracles. "], ["describing Auschwitz", "I would like to tell you how I found-- if I can remember-- how Auschwitz looked to me. Confusion. I think that when the Bible talks about Babel, it must have been the most, um, organized place, vis-a-vis Auschwitz. Everything went fast. They did not give you a chance to think or to contemplate where you are going, what you are going to be doing. They brought us there to destroy our bodies and soul. We did not work. We stood in line for six hours-- three-- three-- six hours daily-- three hours in the morning, and three hours in the afternoon. And it's very difficult to stand when you are a healthy person, but when you are hungry, and you haven't eaten for two, three days, it's very difficult. And many a times, we didn't stand, we just fell. "], ["the interactions with other prisoners in Auschwitz", "Uh, our morale-- I don't know how to call it. I-- I am not talented enough to give you an expression, what the morale was. But if I can just give you a lively picture, we stuck together. So the morale was good. There were people who stole from one another-- a piece of bread-- and today, I can understand it. A mother stole for her daughter. But we were six on the bunk, and nobody stole from anybody. So we were decent human being, even when we were supposed to be like animals. We were even singing sometimes. Would you believe? I remember I was talking about Hungarian goulash. I used to tell my-- my sister in law's, um, sister Esther, if only my mother would m-- make me one Hungarian goulash. I don't care if I die. We used to talk about our boyfriends. And there was something very interesting. We became very intimate with one another. I told people-- women-- things about myself which I would have never told in a normal circumstances-- never. We had not deep secrets, because we were supposed to be so-called decent girls. But we had secrets, like every human being. And we told that to one another. We had to. I don't know why. Maybe to console one another that we had a beautiful life, that we were loved, and we loved, and we were well-dressed, and we were smiling, and we were laughing, and we were joking-- that once, we were alive. And, uh, um, married women were telling us all about their marital problems. My sister-in-law told me about my brother things that she would never dare to tell me today. She's alive. She-- she most likely forgot about it. But maybe she had to. And, uh, I did not think that it was grotesque, at all. "], ["cleanliness in Auschwitz", "We were clean. We washed ourselves every day. There was a bathroom with, um, sinks, which were maybe 50 sinks. And every morning, I think of-- I don't remember. It was morning or afternoon. We washed ourselves very-- we washed each other. I remember washing my girlfriend's back with soap and water, and we were even laughing sometimes. We were washing our hair, which was maybe, uh, one millimeter, already, long. And, uh, we made fun of ourselves. Maybe it was good this way, that we were able to laugh at ourselves. The bunks where we lived were clean, absolutely spotless. Don't ask me how. I don't know. We cleaned it up every morning. "], ["sleeping in Auschwitz", "My pillow was a pot. I still remember. I found the pot, somewhere, on the f-- on the yard in Auschwitz, and I put it under my neck. And that's the way I slept. So my sister-in-law said, oh, I can't sleep. So I gave her the pot. So one night, she had it, and one night, I had it. And, uh, it was beautiful. INTERVIEWER 2: The pot was metal? EDITH PRAKINS.: The pot was metal, yes. Yes. I didn't feel any, uh, hardship. "], ["the worst things of Auschwitz", "I think the worst of Auschwitz were two things-- hunger, no work. We were lying in those bunks all day long and talking about our past. That was-- and the humiliation of our souls-- that was the worst part of Auschwitz. And in the evening, when you dared to go out, and you saw the flames of the crematorium, that was disastrous. The smell of the human flesh, which we didn't know it was-- we were young kids, inexperienced of such horror. Who is experienced in such ways? And, um, we smelled something. We saw a few people commit suicide, run to the wires. They couldn't take it anymore. Auschwitz, if I would like to describe it, I would say that is-- there has not in-- there has not been-- uh, people did not invent an expression like Auschwitz was. It was hell on earth. And the silence of Auschwitz was hell. The nights were hell. And the days-- somehow, we-- we got up at 3 o'clock in the morning, and at 4 o'clock summertime, or 4:30, when the sun came up, it was not like the sun. I swear to you, it was not bright! It was always red to me. It was always black to me. It never said-- nev-- nev-- never was life to me. It was destruction. The sun was never beautiful. And when the, uh, moon was out, it meant only destruction. "], ["not becoming like animals", "We almost forgot what life was all about. But we are supposed to be the chosen people. I never believed in that. But maybe we are chosen. We always stayed humanitarian, even there, took care of each other. I think we are chosen for that, that we didn't kill each other. I used to be so hungry that I thought if a dog would pass by, I wanted to eat the chair if I would have seen the chair It hurt me so that I wanted to run, and scream, and go mad-- just go mad. I was so hungry. And there was all my colleagues-- prisoners-- and I would have never done any harm to them, ever. And I don't-- I would be a fool to say it's-- it happened because I'm Jewish and I'm different-- by no means. But if we are chosen, then we are chosen for that, that we always understand the underdog. And we strive for a better life, not only for ourselves, but for our, uh, neighbors. And that's the way we all conducted ourselves in Auschwitz-- always. They wanted us to become animals, and I haven't seen one-- not one woman-- who died as an animal. We were all dignified. "], ["Edith's attitude towards the Germans", "I just want to say I've been liberated 35 years-- going to be this month-- uh, April 14th. And as I get older, and my children are no longer all self-sufficient, no longer at home, and I am not busy being a mother and a wife, and I can be myself, I have given great enough thought how I should-- I should conduct myself with the-- with the Germans-- how I should feel. Should I hate them? Should I despise them? Should I go out with a banner and say, do something against them? I-- I don't know. I never found the answer in my own soul, and I have to go according to my own conscience. I cannot conduct myself what my husband does, not my children, or what the world has said. And the only thing I can say is that up until now, I ignore them, I don't hate them. I can't hate. I feel I would waste a lot of time in my life. But sometimes I wish, in my darkest hours, that they would feel what we feel, sometimes, when we are uprooted and bring up children. I'm talking as a mother and as a wife. And there is nobody to share your sorrow or your great happiness. There's nobody to call up and say, something good happened to me today. Oh, I have given birth to a beautiful daughter, or she got all A's, or she got into a good college. And mostly, when-- when, uh, holidays come, I have tried to, um, uh, preserve the holidays as I saw it at home, transfer it to my own children. We have beautiful Passovers, like I saw it at home, but the spirit is not there. It's beautiful. My friends tell me-- I invite them-- that it's beautiful, it's very spiritual, but I know it's not the same. It-- it-- I-- I-- there is something missing. I want to share it with somebody who knows me really. My children are all grown up, and there's nobody that Mom and Dad. There isn't even a grave to go and cry to. And I sometimes wish they would feel that. It's not easy to live this way. You don't live with it every day. I have lived 33 years for the future, and very happily. And every so often, I cry, because I'm a feeling human being. And I don't wish the German nation any harm, but I hope that those who have done it know what we have-- the loss of identity, the loss of communication with people that you really trusted. We had to build up everything ourselves, and I-- I am among the lucky ones, because I married a native American, and I came into a family. But what about those people who did not? They are still in exile. They love this country, and I do too. "], ["the love to the USA", "This country is my mother. I-- I mean it. I am-- now that we are talking about women going to the army, my oldest daughter asked me, Mom, would you volunteer? I said, any time. I'll give my life to the United States, because I know what it is. I know both worlds, and with all its shortcomings, it's paradise, for the simple reason I'm able to express what's in my soul, and nobody will harm me for it. "], ["proud to be Jewish", "And I can also say-- and I'm very proud to be Jewish. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe we did not give the greatest musician in this world, nor the greatest sculptors, but surely we are the most literary people in the world. And that's why we survived-- I believe in that. We had better generals than Joshua. The world had better ge-- generals then Diane and wiser men than Solomon, and better kings than King David. But we are a literary people, and that's the only way to survive. I'm very devoted to our people, without really hating anybody or saying that we are the chosen-- no, we are not. We are just like everybody else. If only they would let us be ourselves. And that's the way I brought up my children, which brought me a lot of dilemma in my life, because I said every-- every person is born equal. And then, sometimes I ha-- have to swallow my own words.

EDITH PRAKINS.: Terrible! When I heard about Cambodia, I went through a depression, because the world has not learned. I felt guilty that I'm living in a beautiful home with all the comforts, and I'm impotent. I do nothing. It pains me terribly that the world has not learned that don't kill your brother or sister, no matter what the reason is. And I share the guilt today, I do. INTERVIEWER 2: The guilt? EDITH PRAKINS.: The guilt of the world, that we just sit and do nothing about the Cambodians, or the Vietnamese, or what we hear about Africa. Nobody stands up and be counted. I don't consider myself a coward person. And many a times, I say, why am I so busy that I cannot be counted? I don't stand up. I don't take a banner in Wallingford, Connecticut, where I live, and say, do something! That the Cambodians, in two years, will not exist-- it's the same thing. Why don't I do something? Why am I so busy? Or did I really forget everything already? Am I that comfortable, that I don't want to leave? Or am I just plain tired? I don't know. I have no answer. But it pains me terribly, and I'm restless. That's the truth. And my family knows it, and they feel the same way. But we are all engaged in our own, um, private lives and busy lives. And there's no time for it, and it's wrong. I don't have the answer. I feel we should be the ones who stand up. And I don't. INTERVIEWER 2: Jesus. I told him. He knows. "], ["name and origin", "INTERVIEWER: Your name? ANNA GOLDBERG: My name is Anna Goldberg. My maiden name was Steuer. I was born in Drohobych, Poland in 1929. "], ["under the Russians", "1939, when the war broke out, I was 10 years old. The Russians entered Drohobych at that time. And my family was affected tremendously, because my father was in business for himself. He employed one person. And therefore, he was considered a capitalist. So we were-- our properties were confiscated. And my father had to go to work in a factory. Then two years of school, elementary school, which were very pleasant to a child of a 10, 11-year-old. Because you know, it did not affect me as much, you know, the change in living with my parents until 1941 when the Germans entered. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember conversations in your house about your parents, what they felt about the changes? ANNA GOLDBERG: Well, yes. You mean the changes as far-- when the Russians first entered? My father was very strongly anti-communist. So of course, the fact that they didn't believe in God, it was already-- they had a strike against them, plus the fact that, as I said, they confiscated our properties. And they gave us a six-months passport. You know, citizens of Russia, you have to-- they all have passports now. If you are a desirable citizen, it's five-year passport. But we had only six-months passport. Because as I said, he was considered a career capitalist, because he was a property owner plus self-employed person. And there were always-- there was always the fear of being sent to Siberia. Any time my parents would-- my father would say something, my mother would run out to check if somebody doesn't listen onto the window. And this was going on for two years or so. In school, I did not view as much anti-Semitism as I did before the war, in all honesty. But for the word Jew, they were-- you know, there was something, like, I believe six months jail sentence. So to me, you know, it was a little bit-- for me, it was easier in the school surroundings. For my parents, it was very difficult-- and as I said, until 1941 when the Germans entered. "], ["the German occupation", "The war broke out between Germany and Russia. And the Germans entered. And by that time, both my sisters were married. It was only my brother and I that were home. My younger sister had the baby. And they lived not too far away from us. The day the Germans entered, my father felt very strongly that the Germans-- Germany, being the most cultural country in Europe, that all those rumors we did hear about prosecution against Jews, that it's all communist propaganda, that there was nothing to it. It's impossible that a cultural nation like Germany should actually be capable of all those atrocities that we have heard of. So my brother was 19-- 18 at that time. And he wanted to join the Russian Army. He says, he heard such rumors about what's going on in Germany. He says, if I have to die, let me die fighting back. And my father felt strongly against it. He was a Polish citizen. He fought for the Polish independence and the early 1900s. And he says, if it would be for Poland, that's different, but not for Russia to give your life for. And he felt, again, strongly that they were only rumors. So and therefore, my brother did not join. "], ["the first day of the Germans in town", "And the first day the Germans entered Drohobych, they gave 24 hour free hand to loot, murder and kill Jewish people. So the first time it happened, I have to say that our neighbors were tremendously helpful. First of all, my father lived there for 30-some-odd years. My parents lived on the same property. A lot of them were very good friends. Even so, it was strictly-- very few Jewish families lived in that area. Because that time, in European towns, most of the time, Jewish people concentrated their own made ghettos. So-- but my father felt strongly-- you know, he felt Polish. He was a Pole. And that's that. He did not feel that he's a Jew in any way. And if somebody felt this way, it's too bad. He felt differently. So we were hiding. The first day, he was absolutely in shock when he found out the neighbors surrounded the house to keep the looters out. My mother sent my brother upstairs into the attic to hide. And then something came about. She had some feeling. So she climbed the stairs upstairs. And there was my brother making noose out of rope. INTERVIEWER: A noose? ANNA GOLDBERG: Like a hanging-- INTERVIEWER: To hang. ANNA GOLDBERG: He said, as he saw that the people were coming in-- and most of them were peasants from surrounding villages, drunk, really not capable of understanding even what they were doing. And when they were trying to get through the line of our neighbors, he felt that he would rather take his own life than give them the satisfaction to kill him. So she talked him out of it. And as I said, our neighbors were very good about it. That time, they felt, yet, very strongly. It just happened. It was a shock. My sister, who was a pharmacist, and whose husband was drafted into the Russian Army when the war broke out between Germany and Russia, lived a block away. And she got petrified. So she sent the baby with a mate-- the Ukrainian girl that worked for her send the baby to her mother's. Because after all, she felt that's the safe place is in her parents' house. And one of the neighbors took the baby in. That was our introduction that lasted 24 hours. That was our introduction to the German Army when they entered the first day, when they entered Drohobych. I wasn't even home at that time. It was a very-- I was in the neighbor's house across the street, only other Jewish neighbor with a Ukrainian girl playing Dominoes when my-- the girl's mother, Mrs. Steich, was sitting on the veranda with a neighbor. And she ran in and they said something in Yiddish, which I didn't understand at that time, to her husband. They both jumped out the window and left the three kids sitting at the table, shocked, not knowing what to do. So we ran outside to see, what's the commotion? And some of the villagers, you know, some of the people from villages where there with knives and axes. And so that other Jewish girl managed to escape. But I was so shocked that I couldn't move at that point. And the Ukrainian girl, my girl friend who I grew up, stood by me. And at that time, he said, she is dark haired. She looks Jewish. So there, another guy turned around to me and asked me, are you Jewish? And I was so stunned-- you know, too scared to admit it, and yet, too proud to deny it. So I just stood and stared at him. So one of them said, well, she must be Jewish if she does not say anything. When my Ukrainian girlfriend jumped in front of me, she says, no she's not! She's not! Can't you see? She is deaf and dumb. She can't talk. And that's what saved me, actually, in this-- at this particular moment. So as I said, that was our introduction. "], ["the Germans killing Jews in the woods", "And after this, it got progressively worse. And within a year, my mother was killed, my sister, her little girl who was two-and-a-half years old at the time. INTERVIEWER: How? ANNA GOLDBERG: They had actions where they-- first, they would take people to work. The people never returned. And it took us almost a year to realize that there is something wrong. Because they would receive card saying how well they are doing. The handwriting was genuine. So they knew-- like, my uncle, the first week, he disappeared. And yet, a card came in in his handwriting that he's working. He's doing very well. And that assured the family that he's all right. And so what's happened to those Jews at that time is they took them out in the wilderness, and shot them, and buried them, 218 people, I believe. Most of them were leader-quality people. That's the first thing that they would always get rid of. INTERVIEWER: How did you know? ANNA GOLDBERG: How did I know they were leader-- INTERVIEWER: No, how did you know they were shot? ANNA GOLDBERG: I did not know until later on. We found out that they were taken outskirts and were in the woods and killed. Primarily, they were doctors, lawyers, as I said, people of intelligence, people who were capable of leadership. But before-- evidently, before they were killed, they made several of those people write notes and addressed them prior-- you know, evidently, while they were waiting there. And he must have dictated them what to write. So in a case, like, you know, this, when the letter came in, the card, the family was much more at ease. They figure, well, he's working. He must be well, never knowing that he was dead a long time already. "], ["hearing rumors", "So-- and this was-- after that, within a year or so, we realized what's going on, that those people are never heard of. Then some rumors came in from the Ukrainian-- Black Nazis, we used to call them-- the Ukrainian police force, who cooperated with the Nazis. And in a drunken fit or so, they would tell stories. So those stories started to circulate. And we realized that there must be some truth to it, because we never heard from those people again. "], ["people trying to hide", "So then people started to-- tried in any way possible to hide, or send their children away, or give their children away to be brought up in a safe place. Some people paid-- that had money-- paid a lot of money to the Christian people, in order to save, primarily, children, you know, that they were trying to save the generation to come. And by that time, you know, people were not just waiting around or are willing to go for those calls to work when they called them to meet in a market place and they're going to go to work. They had made it tougher for them to find them. So-- but somehow, it was very difficult, because the cooperation of the Ukrainian and Polish people were so tremendous with the Nazis that it was very difficult for a Jew to hide any place, or as I said, very few undertook, actually, the risk of helping a Jewish person. "], ["the family being killed on gas trucks", "So that's when they came in and they found my mother, and actually, my sister and the baby. Because of the baby, you know, it was difficult. She was two-and-a-half years old. She knew she was Jewish. She knew her name, a bright youngster. So there was-- and she would not leave her. So therefore, she could not save herself. But my mother went along to see if she could convince her-- she was 26 years old at that time-- that she will take care of the baby if she can convince her to jump out of the train. I understand-- I did not know at the time. But after the war, I found out that most of those trains that they took in action of Jews, they went to Belzec or Belz. INTERVIEWER: Bergen-Belsen? ANNA GOLDBERG: No. Belz or Belzec, where they had trucks where those people were actually, you know, put to death by gas on trucks, instead of crematoriums. INTERVIEWER: I've never heard about this. ANNA GOLDBERG: So I know that, you know, my mother, my sister and my little niece were taken the same day and never heard of. So I just surmise that that's what happened to them, since majority of the population from Drohobych was killed in this manner. A lot of people, young people, especially young boys, managed to escape and join the underground. "], ["in a gestapo camp", "INTERVIEWER: Where were you? ANNA GOLDBERG: I was in a camp. This camp had-- it was not a ghetto-- 35 Jewish families. It was called the Gestapo Camp on Janowska Street. INTERVIEWER: How did you get there? Why did you go there? ANNA GOLDBERG: My grandfather was a blacksmith. My father had a place where the buses that travelled from one city to another stayed overnight. And his serviced the buses. But as a young boy, he picked up some of the trades from his father. So he knew a little bit about the blacksmith. Now there are not too many blacksmith, Jewish blacksmith. And that was a rare type of a trade. And whatever he didn't know, he added on, in order-- once he realized that that's what can save his life. And as a matter of fact, they turned the garages into blacksmith shops and the garages, too. And my father was in charge of it. And we lived in our own house, not in ghetto. When they liquidated the ghetto, a lot of Jewish people who were able to escape from to ghetto, there's no place to go. The only Jewish person that they knew that lives on the outside-- outskirts of ghetto, they came to us. And of course, one of the Ukrainian neighbors reported that there was an influx of Jews coming out of the ghetto and hiding in our house. So the Gestapo came in. And they found quite a few Jewish families. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the day the Gestapo came? ANNA GOLDBERG: I wasn't there. I had the terrible nightmare in middle of the night. And I started to cry. And my brother forced aboard in somebody's-- it was like a stable where they had hay or one of the neighbors several blocks away. And I hid-- and he hid me in there. So I wasn't there when they came to take. Otherwise, I would have never survived. Because my father's brother was taken in this action, too. They took her away. And he couldn't do anything. He did manage to get my brother out and few-- about three other Jewish youngsters, who were 18, 19-year-olds. Of course, they took him away when one of the Gestapo men said, look, he's the only Jewish man in this trade. And we need him. So they got-- they told them to get off the truck, when he says, I'm not moving unless my son goes with me. So they said, all right. Get your son down. So once he was down already, he got his composure back. And so he says, well, how do you expect me to run a shop without help? So he says, how many-- he had two kids helping him-- how many helpers do you need? He says, eight. He's say, no. You can't have eight. You can have only four. So therefore, he would managed the closest one to him, four Jewish boys, get them off the truck, which they were not been working for him, but just to save their lives. He saved their lives for another year and a half. Because a year and a half or so later, they died in concentration camp anyway. But-- and then they made us go to this camp, which they had already arranged, but they-- as a punishment for helping other Jews from the ghetto to leave our home and go and live in that camp, this gestapo camp. Now I was hidden there, because I was only 14 years old and you had to be 16 to be able to work. Under 16, you were considered a child. So my father and my brother were hiding me until towards the end of-- the beginning of 1944, that they discovered I am there. But by that time, the war changed already. They knew they are losing, the Germans. So they were a little bit easier, you know. They eased off, as far as the killings were concerned. "], ["hiding in the gestapo camp", "INTERVIEWER: You were hiding in the blacksmith's shop? ANNA GOLDBERG: No, I was hiding. We had a one-room apartment. And my father both a double closet, like a double wall, where my brother put a bulb in and-- when I had to stay there, I was actually in this one-room apartment. And whenever I would hear the German inspection going around-- actually, what they were looking for is cleanliness. And they just walked in to see if it's clean or not. They never checked the closet. INTERVIEWER: Where was the apartment? ANNA GOLDBERG: The apartment was on the premises right there with the camp. There were several apartments occupied by the 35 Jewish families. INTERVIEWER: You never left the apartment? ANNA GOLDBERG: I never left that apartment, only at night to get some fresh air-- INTERVIEWER: How long? ANNA GOLDBERG: --in the middle of the night. For about a year, over a year that I was hidden there. INTERVIEWER: With no one? Were you alone? ANNA GOLDBERG: Well, my father and my brother lived there, too. And my father, they liked him. In other words, he was-- he spoke a very good German. And when he was born, Drohobych was Austria, Austro-Hungary. When I was born, it was Poland. So therefore, his schooling started in a German-speaking school. INTERVIEWER: What did you do with yourself all day? ANNA GOLDBERG: Well, I am a reader. And my brother always supplied me with books, which-- that my pastime. Gee, I think by the time I was 14, I finished all the works of Leo Tolstoy. And at this point, whatever he could get his hands on, as long as, you know, it was not something very dirty or so, he would always-- he would beg, steal or borrow books if he could, just to bring them to me to read. And I spent most of my time, actually, reading. I was always-- the only jealously and resentment I had of my Christian friends is the fact that they could go to school and I couldn't. INTERVIEWER: We you afraid? ANNA GOLDBERG: I couldn't-- the Jewish children were forbidden the minute-- INTERVIEWER: Were you afraid while you were in the apartment? ANNA GOLDBERG: I was afraid, yes. There was always the constant fear of being killed, you know? There's no question about it that you have to, you know-- you never knew when my time comes or when they decide to liquidate the camp. INTERVIEWER: But the inspections, were you afraid you would not know when the inspections would come? ANNA GOLDBERG: Yes, I would-- no, more or less, I knew they-- always somebody warned my father ahead of time that there was an inspection coming. So I would-- he would just come running into the apartment and lock me in. And then I would lay there quietly until the inspection was over. "], ["getting caught", "And then I remember one day that I didn't make the closet and they discovered that I'm there. And that was, I think, January. It was the beginning of 1944. INTERVIEWER: Can you remember that day? Can you tell us? ANNA GOLDBERG: Yeah, not only that day, I remember the name of the gestapo man who found me. And his name was [INAUDIBLE]-- [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]. And when he found me, he says, who are you? What's your name? So I said, Dola which was my Polish nickname-- Steuer. So he says, how are you related to the old mann Steuer I was a change of life baby. My father was 60 years old when I was 15. So I said, that's my father. So he says, I can't believe it he still has such a young child, and then, how did you get here, and started questioning me. And I thought, well, that's the end of me. When my father came running, and he explained to him what happened, and that otherwise I would have been killed, and that's my youngest child. And so he let me stay in camp. He says, at this at this point-- you know, as I said, that was 1944. And the war turned around where the Russians were advancing. And so he says, OK, just let her stay inside. Don't let anyone else see her outside. "], ["taken to a concentration camp", "So it was only a few months longer that we stayed. Because in April of 1944, they took us from there to a concentration camp near Plaszow-- near Krakow. The concentration camp was Plaszow. "], ["the gestapo man who found Anna", "INTERVIEWER: May I ask you, was there any attempt by that gestapo man to use you? You must have been a beautiful young girl. ANNA GOLDBERG: No. He was a man in his 50s, early 50s himself. He really in no way-- and as I said, as a matter of fact-- [BEEP] "], ["fear", "INTERVIEWER: OK, before you went to Plaszow, what you were feeling and what-- SUBJECT: Well, it-- it was a constant fear. It was a constant fear, not only for my own life, but my father's and my brother's. And uh, the atrocity were still going on. From time to time, they would catch a Jewish boy or-- I remember my cousin, my father's sister's daughter, who in another camp. She came in. She was at that time about 17, a very pretty girl. And she was very distraught because they were attacked by the black Nazis, which are the Ukrainian Nazis, and raped six girls. And she was very bitter and very upset and frightened. As a matter of fact, the second time it happened, one of them killed her because she-- she said that that time when she came to visit us, she said that if ever happens again, she would rather-- he should kill her than actually rape her. So she was killed in one of those attacks, where they attacked. There were several Jewish girls that-- it was a camp like a farm, where the Jewish girls were working. So to me, at that time, you know, I knew about these things. I knew what was going on around me. But as I said, actually did not happen. I was frightened when, uh, we went to Plaszow. That was the worst time at this time. I thought that, you know, my father just turned 60, the fear of losing him in Plaszow and the shocked coming in and seeing, you know, that people were just like animals treated, even because-- as I said before-- I was hidden while I heard all of this. I was-- I didn't actually witness any death. Uh, I did not actually see that person until I came to Plaszow. "], ["hanging boys who stole potatoes", "And then there were three Jewish boys-- 16, 17-year-olds-- who-- who were working in a potato field and being hungry. They stole three potatoes, each one a potato, and ate it raw. And to teach a lesson, they were hung in the marketplace. And we all had to walk parade and watch them being-- you know, how they executed them. And-- and then more and more occurs, more and more death traps. "], ["taking kids to Auschwitz", "And there was a kindergarten still, about 30 some odd children in Plaszow. One day, they came in and took all the children to Auschwitz, with the exception of one child who was 10 years old. She managed to escape. She was a survivor. She-- at that time, she knew enough to jump into a outhouse. And that's how she survived. She did not survive. She was died eventually in Auschwitz. But uh, she survived for a few months longer. "], ["Anna's feelings", "INTERVIEWER: Do you remember what you were thinking when you saw the three boys who were hung? SUBJECT: I was in complete shock. I was numb, nothing. You know, there's-- it's very hard to even describe my feeling because the fear and the day-to-day existence in this camp was just more, you know, than any human being could imagine. Maybe the fact that I was only 15 years old help me, you know? And sometimes you say, you're young and stupid. Now my sister came out and it were-- it affected tremendously, mentally, physically. But at that point, all I could think of is well, maybe tomorrow it will be better for that miracle that you're waiting from day to day to happen. Maybe tomorrow it will happen. So actually, well, I lived only from day to day. "], ["taken to Auschwitz", "And as I said, from-- it got progressively worse as I-- it went. The next year between 1944 and 1945, the worst anyone can ever go through, any human being can ever go through, mentally and physically. INTERVIEWER: What happened? SUBJECT: Uh, in 19-- in November, 1944, they took us to Auschwitz. Now they were all young girls selected over and over so many times already that I think that, oh, this person was 33 years old. INTERVIEWER: What do you mean, selected over and over? SUBJECT: Usually for work, they selected young, healthy-looking girls or women. And we were all young. And so at that point, when we arrived in Auschwitz, I remember on the train with this-- so we knew once we came close to Auschwitz, the smell of human flesh was unbearable. INTERVIEWER: You knew-- SUBJECT: Burning human flesh-- we knew that we are going to Auschwitz. Till that time, we didn't know where we are going. INTERVIEWER: You knew what the smell was? SUBJECT: We knew right way, because we heard already about Auschwitz from people when we came to, uh, Plaszow. So we knew. And I remember-- we decided that if we have to die, um, let us not give them the pleasure of seeing us cry. So we decided that we are going to sing a song, a Hebrew song or so. And believe it or not, between 89 girls that we were on that train, there was only one that knew the \"Hatikvah\" or a similar-- a Hebrew song. There was nothing that we knew as far-- you know, some kind of, you know, affiliation. We were brought up in Poland at that-- at my age already as Poles, or maybe because I was brought up in a non-Jewish neighborhood. It's possible. So we got out of the train. "], ["arriving at Auschwitz", "And the German, the Nazis were waiting for us. And one girl started singing the Polish national anthem. And believe it or not, we all picked it up. And there we stood, Jewish girls, the only crime committed was because we were Jews, singing a Polish anthem. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember it? SUBJECT: Some words, yes. INTERVIEWER: Can you sing now? SUBJECT: Well, I don't think so. I remember the words, marsz, marsz, Dabrowski, z ziemi wloskiej do Polski. Exactly, I-- I don't-- you know, I forgot already the words to it. It was-- but that time, as I said, we were singing this Polish anthem, despite the fact that, you know, in Poland, we are still considered as Jews. But we just wanted to show our resentment in some way, our pride in some way. And we were surprised to find out that they seemed to be so pleasant and-- until actually, we got into Birkenau, until they took us out from the trains into Birkenau. And then again, the segregation started-- children on one side. There were not too many other women. I think there was one that was in her 30s. But she looked a little older, so they put her aside anyway. Uh, that was for crematorium already. "], ["Mengele", "And Doctor Mengele was staying, you know, one line to crematorium, one line to work, one line to crematorium, one line to work. And that was the selected was. INTERVIEWER: How did you know-- how did you know who he was? Uh, SUBJECT: At that time, I knew only that he was the camp's doctor. I did not know his name, actually, who he was until later on. "], ["the shock while arriving to Auschwitz", "You know, there were people already that were longer there. When we came in, there were a lot of people from Yugo-- Czechoslovakia and Hungary, a lot of girls. And I remember when we came in and they told us, you came in through that gate but you are going out that chimney, pointing to the crematorium chimneys. And I was 15 years old at that time and also in a complete shock. And I don't know how-- come to think of it, how was I able to survive one shock after another? "], ["meeting sister", "There, I met my sister who I thought she was hidden by a Gentile couple. And I thought she's safe in where she lived in Boryslaw in Poland. But evidently, they refused to hide her and her husband together because they were afraid. They didn't mind her, because she was blond, blue-eyed. But they were afraid that if they catch them, her husband, being so easily identifiable as a Jew, uh, will actually bring some repercussion from the Germans. So they were afraid to hide him. And she made that decision that she's going to go wherever her husband goes. She did not want to live unless she goes with her husband. So they separated them. They sent him to Mauthausen. And they sent her to Auschwitz. And that's where I met her. "], ["an incident regarding a child being separated from her mother", "And, um, it was quite-- you the worst so. Every one of-- every one of the concentration camps held some horrors. But I think Auschwitz was the worst. We-- this child that survived, this 10-year-old girl, of course she was separated from her mother. And that experience I think haunted me for years to a point where, you know, mentally I, uh, transferred that somehow to my own child. When they took her away, she was screaming and fighting. And it took about three brave, husky, Nazi soldiers to catch her. She was kicking and scratching and-- and running. And they were chasing her all over the place. And she-- her mother was there, too. And she was screaming and asking her mother not to let-- not to let them kill her. So one of the German walked over to the mother and ask her if she-- and she was about 27, 28 years old at that time, a young woman herself for a 10-year-old child. And he ask if she wants to go with the child. And she said no. And this left a tremendous effect on me, the fact-- you know, as they led the child away bodily. Three guys had to led-- led this 10-year-old girl away because she was fighting so desperately to live, that at that point in my mind, I blamed her for not going with her child. Then I thought, who am I to blame her? What would be my decision in a case like this? And of course, years later when my daughter was born, Susan-- the firstborn-- I had nightmares, and continuously the same nightmare over and over again, where this time, I was faced with the decision that I have to make. And it would be Susan that I have to make that decision about. And this continued poorly. I would wake up every night. This continued for a-- the child was almost a year when I went to see my doctor. Of course, I was ashamed to admit like what's wrong with me. I developed ulcers and lost a lot of weight. Finally, I told him the story. He was very understanding. He stayed with me longer than normally he-- he did. He even offered if I would like to go and see a psychiatrist, which at that time, you know, it was something that, you know, that I thought, I'm not going to. I was a close person, where I-- I would not divulge my feelings openly. He was the only one, the first time that they ever discussed it with. And he explained to me that it's quite a normal reaction, uh, to have after what I have witnessed. And it evidently stayed with me in back of my mind for so many years that it came out when my firstborn, a girl, when she was born, that-- and at that point, I al-- the fear for her life was so great that, uh, every time the same dream would reoccur. And I saw him several times after that. He was internist. He was not a psychiatrist. But yet, he was able to help me understand a little bit more and to relax of my own emotional turmoil at this point over this one scene. Uh, then after that, of course, were other incidents. And-- but this one was one of the worst that I never wanted even to think of until a certain time later in life. "], ["witnessing people being put to death by injections", "INTERVIEWER: What other incidents? SUBJECT: Well, there were incidents in camp where I would see, you know, people get sick. And uh, they disappeared. And I was told, you know, instead of go-- there were no hospitals or anything else. So they would give them injection, uh, and put them to death. "], ["the selection for work", "There was-- then also at the same time, you know, the second one when we were selected for work. As I said, I was 15 years old and very naive at this point. I was protected too much by my father and my brother at this point, too. Despite the fact that I was in concentration camp already in Plaszow, I came into Auschwitz not prepared for the horror that I have witnessed there. So when we came to-- for selection to work and she asked me how old I am, I said 15. And of course, she put me aside. Now I realized that, uh, I was there left with a few girls who were very sick. Some of them had this, um, skin disease that is very contagious. And that's the only reason they put them aside. It was contagious at that time and that I'm in a line for crematorium. So after that, I-- there was one of the men, the German, uh, officer who did say, but she's strong. She's young. She's going to be 16 in April, and that was November. Ah, well, it didn't make any difference to her. The law is the law. And the law says 16. You cannot work before-- under 16. Well, anyway, I managed to escape and rejoin my group, and until I saw actually the number on my arm, which gave me the right to work. "], ["tattooed number on the arm", "INTERVIEWER: What-- what number. You have it now? SUBJECT: I-- you know, have a tattooed number on my arm which meant that I-- INTERVIEWER: I-- I don't think-- I couldn't see it. Do you remember your number? Can you read your-- SUBJECT: No. That's like a mental block with me. I can read that if I look at it. But I just refuse to memorize. It's something that it's there. But I just cannot memorize that, no matter how many times. You know, I tried. An hour later or so, I forget the numbers. I know it starts with A. I can read it now. I know it's 26547. But an hour later, if you ask me, I will not remember the number. INTERVIEWER: Did it hurt when they put that number on you? SUBJECT: You know, emotionally, I was so happy at this point to see that they are going to give me the number for work, to tattoo the number to mean join the workforce, that whatever physical pain there was, I did not feel it so much because sometimes the emotional feeling takes over your physical pain. INTERVIEWER: But it's on the inside of your arm. SUBJECT: Right under the skin. INTERVIEWER: No-- but most of the numbers are on the outside of the arm. Yours is on the inside. Was there a reason? SUBJECT: No. My sister has it on the outside. Some people who came in earlier have it on the outside. I have it on the inside because when I came, the transport I came in, we all were tattooed-- the numbers were tattooed on the inside. "], ["the work in Auschwitz", "Uh, and then I-- they put us in Muster Lager. That's in Auschwitz. And that's where I worked there for a while. INTERVIEWER: What kind of work? SUBJECT: We were building a highway. There was farm work, but the Gestapo overseer on that farm was a very cruel man. So we always tried to avoid that task as much as possible. Sometimes it didn't help. I know a couple of times, I-- they caught me forcibly. And I had to-- one time, I got hit as a result of that-- to work on the farm. The work itself was like any other work, except that the man was a sadist. And uh, you were in constant fear of getting hit and actually physically abused. And many girls have been in a very cruel way. "], ["going to see a dentist", "So-- and then I remember having a toothache. You know, during all those years, my teeth were neglected. And I developed an abscess in my-- on my gum. The abscess went right through my cheek. And uh, I remember one of the Jewish girls, uh, who was the-- what they call-- call them. She wasn't a kapo. She was an overseer in our room-- fi-- managed to get me to see a dentist, to get to a dental clinic. Now, the dental clinic was not for the prisoners there. I don't know how she did it really. But she managed to get me there. It was a young student, a dental student. And he pulled the tooth and cleaned it up a little bit and sneak me back to camp, into camp. This was on the outskirts of actually our compound there, where we stayed. And uh, there we were till January of 1945. INTERVIEWER: If they hadn't pulled that tooth and removed that abscess, what would have happened? SUBJECT: Well, my face was swollen completely. My eye was closed. And uh, I don't know how-- at this point, they wouldn't bother. Because a lot of girls that h-- had lesser disabilities than that and they were put-- they were not bothered with, just put in crematorium, you know, put to death. Because they didn't want to be bothered with doctors or-- I don't know why in that case it so happened that this girl had a pull there or, uh-- sometimes I think it's a miracle, to be very honest with you, you know? "], ["wondering how she survived", "There's-- I-- since that time, I never questioned why. Because if I would, I would won-- I wonder myself, how did I ever survive it? I was not very strong. I was not physically strong. Uh, I was not one of the brave ones. Uh, you know, I was a mere child at that point. How did I survive? I don't know. "], ["the kapos/superintendents", "INTERVIEWER: Who chose the kapos or the superintendents? How did someone become, uh, in charge? SUBJECT: Well, when we came in, uh, the kapos, the superintendents, usually-- they were already there. A lot of them were Hungarian girls who came in before us. Um, sometimes a very aggressive girl-- one girl I remember, a Polish girl, who was a very aggressive type of a person and, um, and not a very nice person that, you know, they could distinguish right away who would cooperate or not or so and who was easy to cooperate. So they would select such a person for cooperation. "], ["death march", "And uh, I spend there, as I said, till January of 1945. The Russians were advancing. And they decided to, uh, move us. Now they had no facilities of moving us. And the Germans are the type of people that unless they have an order to kill-- like a dog-- an order to attack, they didn't know what to do. And the orders did not come through because the communications were very poor at that time already with Berlin. The wires were down. And so they started moving us by foot. So we walked for three days and three nights. Whoever couldn't walk was killed wherever they stood by the roadside, on the road. Uh, amazing as it might sound, it were men who gave up easier than women, maybe because they were braver. They did not-- they were not afraid to die. It's possible. Only women, most of them, they just fell dead or really were on the brink of death before they gave up. And see, the road was scattered was bodies. And until we reached Breslow, or outskirts actually of Breslow, there they had trains waiting for us, cattle trains. And they put us on those trains and brought us to Bergen-Belsen. "], ["Bergen-Belsen", "Now Bergen-Belsen, when I came in, you came in to die there. There was no way-- first of all, they had a large group of Hungarian Jews. And while the Polish Jews systematically were mistreated for so many years, they were already prepared to it, they took the Hungarian Jews right straight from their homes. They brought them in in their furs and jewelry and high heels and threw them into this hell. And of course, they started dying out like flies. Typhus was ravaging throughout the camp. Somebody came in. And we were sleeping on the floor, like body to-- like sardines in a can, one head this way, one head that way. And uh, I remember one night, I had to go to the bathroom. I could never get back to the space where I slept. Because as I was tripping over people, you know, they would get angry. And tempers were short. People were hungry. So I stayed at the door outside and sat there and slept the rest of the night until morning to get back to this little space that I had a blanket on. "], ["working", "Uh, when they came in to register for work, uh, I and another girl who were-- we were both, at that time 15, the youngest one in camp. We registered for work. There were about 160 of us, I believe. I don't know exact number. But I know over 150 women that registered. And we went to work in a factory, a munition-- it was, uh, parts for-- airplane parts factory. And uh, there were already 500 girls, Hungarian girls, when we arrived. And we worked there for several months. Then April, 1945, they started to move it. "], ["birthday in camp", "How do I remember it? It was my birthday. I was 16 years old, April 3rd. And uh, I came in. And I announced that today, I'm 16 years old. I came from work. And that day, they gave us for supper a slice of bread and a cup of soup, which was only water with some leaves floating around, and a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of, um, jelly. And everybody, oh, the girl is 16, my god. I admitted my age at that point, you know? I reached finally-- I managed to reach 16 birthday. Uh, when I went to wash around, when I came back, on my bunk, each one of the girls-- and we were about 20 some odd girls in that room-- took a-- a piece, a little, tiny piece of her bread. And uh, they put it on a napkin and on my bunk. And of course, I had everybody's mustard. And the first time in a long time that I went to bed that I didn't-- went to sleep, didn't feel the hunger pains that I usually did every night since I was in concentration camp. Because those little, tiny pieces amounted to probably an extra slice of bread. And that night, I got ill. So uh, at first I thought maybe I overate. But it was typhus. And my girlfriend had it first. And I took care of her. She was also-- as I said, we were both very-- the youngest two girls there. So I took care of her. And when she felt better, she helped me out while I was sick. "], ["on a train from Bergen-Belsen", "And they made us-- they moved us because the English-- this time, the British were coming. So they moved us again. And you know, she was helping me up, you know, carrying me on her shoulders. We were on those trains for three weeks. During the three weeks trip, they fed us three times. INTERVIEWER: What trains? I-- I-- SUBJECT: They put this on the, you know, train to move us from camp to camp. They uh, wanted to-- they didn't know what to do with us. INTERVIEWER: You had the typhus then? SUBJECT: And I had the typhus. And at some place in a big city, another train of people, Jewish girls, that joined our train-- by that time, we were close to 2,000 women. Uh, that was within few days after we left Gelenau. Uh, was-- and three weeks, we were traveling from place to place. Nobody would accept us. They didn't have facilities for us. Uh, I remember we were in Prague, Czechoslovakia. I don't know how we got there. That's the time that they fed us, because the pop-- the Czech population stood around with food. And then they wouldn't move until they let them give us some food. Uh, so uh, that was the second time that they gave us food. Then the third time, I don't remember exactly. I know that we were fed three times during the three weeks of traveling. By the time we reach our destination, which was Mauthausen in Austria, from the 3,000-- 2,000 women, we were about 300 of us that were alive, a little over 300. Most of them died during that trip. The only thing that saved me, I think, is the fact that I had typhus, very high fever, and that didn't-- my body did not require food. I don't know why and how. But it was raining. My girlfriend would stand at the bars, the rusted bars, and catch some rain water into a can and feed me the rain water and wash me around with it to bring the fever down. "], ["arriving at Mauthausen", "Uh, and we finally they reached Mauthausen. And as I said, one camp was worse than the other. But that time, it was already the end of April. We started the beginning of April, right? April 3rd was my birthday still-- birthday. "], ["getting healed from Typhus", "So within a week or so after, we were liberated in Mauthausen by the American forces. INTERVIEWER: Do you remember that time? SUBJECT: Yes, because uh, first-- you know, as a result of typhus, uh, it left me completely-- I was dying, actually. I was on the floor. I could hear voices around me. I couldn't see anything or anyone. And uh, this girlfriend of mine, uh, they left-- the Germans left about a day or two prior to the-- when they en-- the American forces entered. And she managed to-- to get out into a farmhouse, a German farmhouse. And they escaped because they knew actually that eventually, if somebody comes in, that they were aware of what was going on in that camp. So they escaped and left the farmhouse empty. And she found some sugar there and a piece of cheese and some tea bag-- not bags, loose tea. And the first thing she did is give me some sugar. And I will never forget that as long as I live. When she gave me sugar and water, I felt like somebody would lift a train, some-- a curtain off my eyes. All of a sudden, I could see. Till that time, I couldn't see. I could only hear. Uh, evidently, this tablespoon of sugar and water must have done it in some way. And then she made me some hot tea with sugar again after that. And I had a piece of cheese. And suddenly, I was able to lift my head up. Till that time, she had to pick my head up to feed me. "], ["liberation", "And about-- within two or three days after that, I remember when, uh, a truck full of American soldiers came in. And uh, one of them was a Jewish officer. And he spoke a beautiful Yiddish, better than any one of us. And as he was talking and he says, I have heard rumors. I have heard, but I was never aware of the real, true story of-- actually, the truth of what was going on. And in middle of his speech, he broke down, started to cry. That's, you know-- it was a terrible thing to watch at this point and also to see a man break down completely. Um, one of the guys, a doctor who graduated from a medical school in England, spoke very good English. And he right away translated what was going on. And at first, I understand I missed that because I was too sick to get off that floor. But I understand the first truck of American soldiers that came in, they got scared. They thought that they are in a mental institution or some place-- something they have never seen before in their lives, skeletons, you know, walking skeletons. And of course, people, when they realized that they are American soldiers, they wanted to, um, show them how welcome they are, and they got scared. They couldn't understand what's going on. So this doctor started explaining to them what this place is and what has been happening here. So they-- well, by that time, you know, they evidently went back and brought some more people. And then the Red Cross came in. And then, of course, everybody wanted to go and see where, you know, some-- somebody is alive. "], ["searching for family", "Uh, I really didn't think so my sister is alive. Because when they took her out from Auschwitz, they-- she was with a group of women from our home town and the surrounding towns. And I found out right after the war what happened to that transport. They put them on a boat and sunk the boat with the people in it, so-- on a old boat. So the first-- I remember in Mauthausen, the first service they had, I said Yizkor for her and went on back to Poland to look for my brother and father. And you can imagine my shock when I found my sister alive. Evidently, she had the feeling that they are not taking them where they were sup-- where they were saying they are taking them. She says, I'm not going in that transport. So she and five other girls-- she was at that time in her late 20s-- uh, jumped someplace that they had like the outhouse and a-- and a bathroom there together. And they hid there. And that's why they are the only ones, the only survivors, from that group. The rest of them were drowned. "], ["trying to go back home", "INTERVIEWER: What did you feel when you went back to your home? SUBJECT: I did not go back to my home. I reached Krakow. And when I announced that I would like to go to my hometown, I was told that it's not Poland anymore, that now it's Russia, that Russia took that part of Poland. In exchange, they gave Poland Niederschlesien, a part of Germany. And therefore, I can't go there without a special permission from the Russians. Now I didn't want to go to Russia. I did not want to live under a communist regime. "], ["searching for family", "So I put together a telegram. I knew wherever there are couple of Jews left, wherever there are two Jews left, there will be a Jewish Committee right away. So I addressed it to the Jewish Committee, saying that I am Dola Steuer, daughter of Solomon Steuer, alive and in Krakow, in case somebody would return for my family. Sure enough, they received the telegram. INTERVIEWER: Your sister? How did you-- SUBJECT: Not my sister-- that was-- my sister, my brother, he survived. They both were in a camp which was Niederschlesien, Germany. But Poland took it over. My brother was a translator for the Russian intelligence right after the war because we were two years under the Russian regime. And at that time, he was in business school. So you know, he picked up Russian as well as I did. And then to his surprise, somehow always every place there was a camp, he was looking for me or my father or-- he found out that my sister is alive. So they found each other right after the war in 1945. And uh, they decided they are going back to their hometown. Because my father, any place else-- you know, if he survived, he will go to the home where he built-- you know, the properties he both for 30 some odd years. And we knew that he will want to go back home. And they put him in a camp, in the Russian camp, for processing before they go. And they were surprised to see that there were no Jews and that they were the only Jews there. And they couldn't understand it. And my brother says, you know, there are still some people that were alive, a few of them, in Galicia. That's where we came from. I can't understand it. So they sneaked out of this camp. And they were walking down in Breslov-- which is now, it's called Bratslav down the street to see if they can come across somebody. When they came across somebody that looks familiar, and my sister stopped him. And it was my younger sister's husband. And of course, it was such a shock to them. And-- and my ex-brother-in-law knew that I am an Krakow. So he told them where I am, where I'm staying. So my sister stayed on in Bratslav. She opened the store with was my ex-brother-in-law. And my brother came to get me. And while he came to get me, he came down with typhus and spent six weeks in the hospital there, where I had to take care of him. And I had to take care of them. At this point, you know, he was the only person in the whole world that I cared for. I was always crazy about my brother. But at that point, he was my father, my mother. And uh, I was, you know, very happy to see him. "], ["life in Poland after the war", "And when he got better, we went back to join our sister in Bratslav. And I joined the high school system there, where I finished two years in one year. "], ["anti-semitism after the war", "And then the anti-Semitism in Poland started all over again. There were a lot of Jews killed, the ones that returned from concentration camp. A friend of ours, her husband was working for somebody in a jewelry store. And they walked into rob the store. And they said, you know, you're a Jew. And they killed him. And more and more of it, you have-- you started hearing here and there and the disappointment that's-- that a few thousand Jews return back to Poland. "], ["deciding to leave Europe", "And I decided that I had enough of Europe. And I said to my brother and sister if they want to stay in Poland, go ahead. But I'm leaving. I just-- I have no ties, no-- in Poland. The-- the country did not mean anything to me. I was very disappointed and very bitter. So uh, they picked themselves up and left with me. By that time, my sister remarried. Her husband died in Mauthausen, her first husband. So she remarried again. And we all left Poland and came to Germany. And we lived there in DP camps for four years until we were able to apply for, uh-- actually, we applied earlier, but until we were able to come to the United States. "], ["visiting Israel", "INTERVIEWER: Did you ever think of going to Jerusalem, to Palestine? SUBJECT: I did. About 12 years ago, when our oldest was 16 years old, we went to Israel. Of course, I cried the first time I arrived. I have seen the Star of David on the ambulances and all over. And I thought, you know, they use it with such a pride, whereas here, they tried to make us wear it with a-- in a shame. So we went to Jerusalem. And uh, I will be very honest with you. We went over, where we have seen everything but Yad Vashem. My daughter went in, but my husband and I refused to go with in. "], ["deciding to move to the US and not to Israel", "INTERVIEWER: Did you think of going to Palestine directly from Europe? SUBJECT: Yes. When I was young, at one point only-- I always wanted to come to the United States since I was a little child. My mother had a brother and a sister here. And from time to time, I would get-- you know, she would get letters from them, a picture of my cousin when she graduated high school. My aunt, I know she died in 1939. She lived in Chicago. She didn't have any children. My uncle, my mother's brother-- I don't know what happened, really. I never was able to locate him. I tried, maybe not hard enough. But I wasn't able to locate him. I know that he had two children. And I-- for some reason, I always wanted to come to the United States until the war broke out in Israel, 1948-- '48, the war for the independence, I believe. And that's when I registered to go and fight in Israel. And my sister was a very sick person. She spent 13 months in a hospital in Heidelberg, or clinic. And when she found out, she passed out. So after that, uh, you know, they did not-- several people, they called in. But they kept postponing with me. I was 17 years old. They kept postponing. And finally, when the war stopped, I saw no reason going to Israel. I thought I will go to the country I always dreamed of. And so I came to the United States.

SUBJECT: Yeah. INTERVIEWER: This is the rule. How do you feel now about obeying the law, law and order? What has your experience, uh-- [SIGHS] SUBJECT: I-- without law and order, I feel our society would be in a complete chaos to a certain degree. We all have to follow the law and order. But I feel-- like for instance, this Dr. Levy who objected to teach soldiers who were fighting in Vietnam, in a way, I-- I feel a certain admiration for this man for the simple fact that he felt he was right there. He knew that there is something wrong. He felt it's the wrong thing to do. And he stood up. He did not follow the crowd. He did not follow blindly. But let's be very honest. Most people do follow very blindly-- most law enforcement officers here, too. That's the order I have. And that's the law I-- and I-- without any, any thought to actually, is it the right thing or is it the right idea?

SUBJECT: Holocaust, I, uh-- as they were showing marching woman in-- women in Auschwitz, and my son who is 19, just turned 19 that time, and my daughters were sitting. And without thinking much, I said to them, uh, you see the third person in the row? That's me. And they looked-- you know, to them, it was just a picture until I said, the third person in the fourth, row, it's me. That came as a shock, that actually, I was one of the-- it was not. I said it without-- you know, as a joke at this point. But it's to bring the point that I was there. I could have being the third person in the fourth row. So it came to them like such a shock. He was-- he couldn't believe it for a second. He stared. And he, like myself, always avoids the unpleasantness of things that are, you know, associated with war-- World War II. But likely more and more, he reads and questions and which is, till now, he didn't want to hear about it. And I never really bothered. I didn't want to make them feel very conscious of it, or maybe-- you know, in a certain way, maybe it was wrong. But yet, they are very much aware of that, what we went through. They much more appreciative, I think, of their parents and very-- if he studies, he would like to get good grades, if only to please us, like compensation for the things we went through. "], ["experiences of her husband during the Holocaust", "INTERVIEWER: Is your husband European? SUBJECT: Yes. INTERVIEWER: Did he suffer? SUBJECT: Well, he was born in Poland but brought up in Hungary. So he was also in Mauthausen, but only a few days. He was a young boy at that time. And he was in the underground when he got caught. And they discovered he's a Jew, of course. They sent him to Mauthausen. And uh, he came in, took one look at it. And he said, I prefer death to that. He was only 19, I believe, at that time. So he escaped and in process of escaping was shot. His legs are very badly. He was wounded. And of course, within days after that, the American forces came in. He was found semi-conscious in the woods. So-- and since he spoke, they couldn't make-- actually understand him well. But one of them understood a couple of Hungarian word-- words they used. So they sent him to Budapest, to a hospital there. They took care of him as much-- operated on him immediately. And this-- and then they sent him. "], ["meeting her husband", "INTERVIEWER: How did you meet? SUBJECT: After the war, we met in a DP camp, displaced persons camp in Germany. After he felt better, he managed to get out of Hungary and come to Germany. INTERVIEWER: You were with him from that point,? SUBJECT: We knew each other for about a year and a half, almost two years. And then when we came to the United States, we got married. I lived in Buffalo, New York, at that time. And he came to Buffalo. And that's where we were married. But we settled in New Haven. That's where he was working. And I thought New Haven is a smaller town. I-- somehow, I preferred New Haven to Buffalo for the simple reason that it's smaller. INTERVIEWER: OK. "], ["NO_TOPIC", "OK.

Why didn't the Jewish people fight? So it hard for me-- I did explain to him that majority of the six million people that died were women and children anyway. Whoever was able to escape joined underground any-- you know, Russian army. I have some place still here a Russian newspaper that in 1946, beginning of 1946, uh, they were distributing medals for bravery to their armed forces. And of course, they distributed under nationality. Now, Jews are considered a nationality in Russia. And the Jewish population of Russia consists of only 3% of the entire population, or 4%-- of that time, anyway, in 1946. And yet 40%, of the heroes who received medals for bravery-- Lenin medal for bravery-- were Jews. INTERVIEWER: What do you tell your son? You just-- what do you tell your son?

At that time, I was in third grade. The next two years, I was still in school. The Russians entered our part of Poland. "], ["life under the Germans", "Then when the war broke out between Germany and Poland, and the Germans came in, the first, biggest trauma to me was not being able to go to school. I watched, every day, children walking, my friends. Some of them were not even students. [CRYING] But they were allowed to go to school, and I was not. That was the biggest problem at that time. It was very hard for me to understand. Then after that, they were other-- first, the attitude was of passiveness. My girlfriends would bring me home the homework. The friendships still existed. Then I would notice a difference in their attitudes. Evidently, the Nazi propaganda got even to the children that age. And less and less of them would come to the house. Some of them even avoided me in the streets when they saw me. At that time, I felt deeply hurt, because at the age of 11 or 12, you just cannot understand, suddenly, what happened. Some of the friends that I had, we used to do homework together. And I would be the oldest one to help them. And when the war started and I was not allowed to go to school, as I mentioned, you know, suddenly the friendship dissolved. Many times, you know, I would come to their homes to see, just to say hello, or be with somebody my own age. Since I lived, primarily, in a non-Jewish neighborhood, I didn't know too many Jewish youngsters. And then I learned to, after a while, to live with my own thoughts, my own ideas, and by myself. I spent most of the time with my family. And my parents were always able to get me books to read. My mother would always select the reading material for me. Then after that, it got progressively worse. Not only did they show the unfriendly attitude, but actually hostility. Most of them were of Ukrainian background. "], ["the Germans taking advantage of the Ukranians", "German-- Germany-- Hitler gave them, promised them, that if they helped him fight, the Ukrainian people-- he formed a certain-- a Ukrainian army, which was called the Black Police-- that they will have a free Ukraine. Of course, he used them as far as the same way as he used everybody else, because they were the first one in line when it came to fighting. And they do-- did realize it after four years, that they are being actually used. There was-- a lot of the young people were sent to work in Germany in factories and forced laborers, while they were telling them they are doing-- they're doing it for German government and they will have special privileges working for them. But it took them almost four years to realize, actually, that they're being used. And they were very helpful in-- to the Germans, you know, in solving what the Germans called the Jewish problem and killing them. And after this, I came more and more across, you know, from ghettos to concentration camps, only across people that felt the same way. That obedience-- uh, they followed orders without questioning. Some of them even without any pang of consciousness. They were afraid to speak or show any sympathy towards Jewish people. "], ["death march", "Or so as I was-- grew older, matured from 11, 12 to 15, there were many times that, when I was in concentration camp, for instance, in Auschwitz-- this famous walk that we walked in January of 1945-- many times, I would have really doubts that there's an existence of God. I would all be, one minute, as we walk those icy, slippery-- slippery roads from early dawn till late at night- we walked because there were no transportation for us, to take us out of Auschwitz. Whoever fell or slipped, they would kill that person on the spot. And they were all young people, because we were already selected, and so many times, that they were all between the ages of 16 and 25. INTERVIEWER: Why were you walking? Where were you walking? Can you explain that a little more fully? SUBJECT: Yes. When the Russians were approaching that part of Poland, and that was Auschwitz, they wanted to move us. And they had no transportation. So they took us to-- so they made us walk. And as I said, there was no food, and we continuously walked from early morning till night. It was in January-- snowy, slippery roads. And many, many people died that-- on that-- the three days that we walked. We walked for three days. Both sides of the roads were scattered with bodies. As I said, whoever slipped or couldn't make it, they would-- shot that person automatically, if you were a man, young men and girls.

And one, especially, Hungarian boy that showed a little compassion. And he kept-- I was at-- I started at the beginning of the line. At the end of the day, I was at the end of the line. I had difficulties keeping up walking. I was helping somebody else who could not walk so well. And I remember distinctly, because that was one of the very few kindnesses that one of the uniformed German soldiers has shown-- he wasn't German. He was Hungarian. But he wore a Nazi uniform. And quietly, he said to me, I will yell, but don't get scared. I will pretend that I am pushing you. But I will hold you up with the butt of the rifle. And somehow, with his help, the two of us made it, this girl who I was helping and myself, the last two hours of the day.

They brought us into a town in Niedersachsen put us in cattle trains, and brought us to Bergen Belsen. And there, also, I couldn't understand the inhuman treatment.

Do you have any concept of how old the people were you were with, and how old the people were who were in charge? SUBJECT: The people that I was with in concentration camp were mostly about two, three years older than myself. Since I was 15, as I said, they were anywhere between 16 and 25, 26 years old, the whole group of women that I was with. The guards that were guiding us were mostly young people a little in their 20s. There were a few old timers.

As a matter of fact, when I-- when the war ended, I had to be on a special diet, because my intestines shrank to the size of a one-year-old child. So-- and a lot of typhus, typhoid fever in Bergen Belsen. INTERVIEWER: What had shrunk to-- what did you say? SUBJECT: That my intestines shrank to the size of a one-year-old child, because of, systematically, hunger. And I had to be on a special diet. For a year after the war ended, I had to be on baby food. Everything had to be creamed. Whatever I ate, it had to be creamed. Because my stomach could not digest regular food. "], ["why the Ukrainians cooperated with the Nazis", "INTERVIEWER: I want to ask several questions. One is, why do you think the Ukrainians-- when you were in Poland, before you went to the concentration camp-- why do you think that the Ukrainians were cooperating with the Nazis in terms of hurting Jews or suppressing-- changing Jewish life? SUBJECT: Well, for years, they always wanted independent country, Ukraine. And if you read any of the old Ukrainian literature, poets like Taras Shevchenko they always, you know, towards the country, the mother country. But they were always either under the Russian domination or the Polish. Hitler, knowing that evidently, promised them an independent Ukrainian state. And they believed him. That he was-- as I said before, he was using them. And he had the perfect material in them, because they themselves were under-- always under somebody else's government. Also considered, you know, not always the first class citizens, because in Poland, there were always class distinctions and so forth. So he used them in that form, by promising them a free country, they cooperated with him fully. And you don't need too much of you repeat over and over again in school to children, and that the Jews are at fault we are in this war. Jews are at fault because there is hunger. Jews are at fault because there is no unemployment-- because there is unemployment in this country. Jews are the ones that have all the money. Which, you know in Poland, there were, I would say 95% of Jews that were really poor. Things, you know, like these, over and over again, combined with the strong religious beliefs at that point. You know, I remember myself, that was before the war yet, I was about eight years old. And I went into a church with my girlfriend. As I said, I lived in a non-Jewish neighborhood. And she went. So I wanted to see what the church looked like. She says don't-- if you promise not to say you are Jewish, I will take you. So I went in, and I was shocked to hear a priest from a pulpit repeating that Jews are Christ killers. When we came out, she couldn't look at me. She was embarrassed or whether she really believed it or not. But yet people there that did not have the best of education or were not actually people who could read and make a-- determine that their own minds, believed that. I remember coming home, crying to my parents. And my first reaction was, why did Jews kill Jesus Christ? Did you kill Jesus Christ, I asked my father. Because he was in World War I, he was an officer. So I thought maybe-- at this point, I couldn't understand it. To me, it was such a-- you know, something that I was not aware of. Of course, I had to admit to my parents what I did, that I went into the church. So instead of getting angry, which I expected them to, because as I said they were deeply religious orthodox people in themselves. There was only one religion, and that was theirs. But I remember my father-- I demanded explanation. I wanted to know what happened. And I remember my father saying that, after all, Jesus Christ was Jewish himself. And I wasn't there, I don't know what happened. But my opinion is that his ideology was not exactly to that of that era. But he was preaching, evidently, the government-- and at that time, the Romans-- he went into details explaining to me that the Romans killed him, actually, not the Jews. But to me, it was such a terrible feeling to find out, you know, that it's taught differently in a church than in a Jewish religious school, which you know, we never had a mention actually. If we mentioned-- if there was any mention, it was that he was a rabbi and a very gentle man and a teacher. That's it. So that's the difference, I always felt was between the Christianity and Judaism until I actually came across that statement in the church. So combined with this religious teaching and the feeling of frustration, not being able to have their own culture exposed, their own country, they took it out on the next person, which were Jews. And as I said, they were very cooperative. It took them about four years or so to realize that they are being used by Germany, that they are using them as their tool of actually doing all the dirty work for them. Because in our part of the country, you know, most of the killings or so were done by the Black Police, which is the Ukrainians. "], ["the Ukranians nowadays", "So by that time, already you know, was like, whoever was guilty ran to-- to Germany. Many of them came to the United States here. And whoever didn't, when the Russians entered, you know, they took really-- they were very revengeful. So it's still this way now. Right now they are under the Russian government and their culture is the Russian culture. So they do not have, actually, still, a culture of their own. Even so, the similarity there in the language between Russian and the Ukrainian exist, there is still not-- it's not their own country. So therefore, you know, he had a perfect tool in the Ukrainians, that he used them. And after the war, many of them had camps in Germany. But they would not admit to being a Ukrainian citizen. They were either Russians who didn't want to live under communist regime or Poles. "], ["the importance of telling the memories from the Holocaust", "INTERVIEWER: What did you-- why do you think it's important that you tell what happened to you and that young people listen to the awful things that you went through? I mean, you're living a good life now. You have a good family. Why do you want to think about it again? Why do you want others to hear it? SUBJECT: Well, I feel it's important that people should be conscious. That there are certain ideologies that are not-- that they should question, actually. Am I right in following this blindly, without actually asking any questions about this idea? Should I believe everything that is said in the newspapers? Should I believe everything that my leader tells me? As has been proven in this country, already, too, that not always the leaders are perfect. That they should, young people especially, should read a lot, should be aware of the fact that not always the truth comes to the surface, and not always the truth is told to the masses. And they should be aware of it and not to believe-- first of all, there isn't a nation that is perfect. Every nation or every religious group has good people and bad people. You cannot declare a whole race or a whole na-- religious group as bad, because it's not so. There are good and bad in everybody and everyone. And therefore, they should be aware of it. I think young people should be more aware of the fact. And before they point an accusing finger at someone, they should actually know the facts about it. INTERVIEWER: Why do you think they should learn about what happened in the Holocaust? Why go back to that terrible time? SUBJECT: It's because the young people at that time, as I said, did follow blindly. It was such a fool faith. "], ["the unawareness of the German population", "You know, I spoke to many German kids afterwards, after the war. I did ask them, you know, youngsters my own age or older than myself. My English teacher was a German young man. I was 18 at that time. He was 21. I asked him. He was in the Hitler Youth. He admitted to it. And he says that, you know, never actually was that-- he had never a choice of ideology. Nazism was-- he was taught from childhood on, and he firmly believed in it. At the age of 16 and 1/2, he was sent to Russia, to the Russian front. And he was wounded there. So 16 and 1/2, that's hardly, you know, a child. But in desperation, they didn't have manpower. So they used children. There was no-- you know, that's when he realized, and actually the truth hit him, that the leader he believes in so faithfully is not at all what he was taught as a child. He realized that he's not for the good of the country. He did not actually-- he used just the times of upheaval, of economic poverty, to come up. And always, he never-- the country was never actually stable. He always used some other maneuver to make people believe, the German people believe in him, and in the country. It took him about six months to realize it, he said, how wrong was the ideology that he was taught as a child all along. He never-- he claims he never knew about concentration camp. And after the war, it became more and more shocking to him as he started learning the facts about concentration camp. People his age I can believe, sometimes maybe, you know, they were not aware. People who were mature adults are the ones, actually, that I blame to this time, and always will blame. Because many of them, even in areas like Dachau-- my father died in Dachau. So few years ago I went to visit his grave. He survived the war and died three weeks after. So his grave is on the outskirts of Dachau. And every place I went around the town of Dachau, I heard one thing-- we never knew about it. Now how can you not know about it, when you can, 30 years later, the smell of human flesh is still lingering on in that place? But you know, they just took-- they were well off as far as economically. The fact that their sons and fathers were being killed on the Russian front or captured by the Russians or so, somehow didn't-- never affected them. They had full stomachs, plenty of food, and that's all they, at this point, that they were interested in. And many-- you know, as a matter of fact, I stopped in a grocery store. And the owner was a man in his 50s, late 50s. So he was in his 20s during the time this was going on. And he says he didn't know. So I say how can you tell-- look me straight in the eye and tell me you lived in this town and you didn't know there was a concentration camp which existed from the 1930-- early 1930s. He says, well, I looked upon it as a camp for communists and criminals only, not actually innocent people. He was never aware of it until after the war. Whether he was telling me the truth or not, I don't know how much was kept away from-- from-- from them. But even if they were communists of a different ideology or criminals, they must have been aware that they are being burned, that there were crematoriums working daily. Even the mayor of the city, of the town of Dachau, when I came to inquire about my father's grave number, was very polite, a young man in his 30s. Went with me, to show me even, more or less, so I wouldn't get lost, where it is. And his first reaction was, I knew nothing about it. So you know, it's something that when you start looking into it-- and yet, when you read about the leaders, the leadership, the German leadership, it's amazing. How many, you know, actually they were-- in my opinion, mentally distorted. And yet, people followed them blindly, without questioning. There were a few exceptions, as we have heard about Paris and other generals who objected, to realize that the man is insane.

Did you have a hope that some day you would meet her again, see her again, she or others? Did you talk about it? SUBJECT: Well, we quite often-- we did have hopes and not specific plans. We, really-- you lived from day to day. And every day you would get up, you would say, thank God another day passed and we are still alive. I did hope that my father, brother, and sister survived. So after the war, of course, I found my father's grave in Dachau. But my brother and sister survived. And that was something that was really beyond my dreams, ever seeing them again. I never even-- I didn't dare hoping that there would be someone alive. And of course, with me, my brother felt the same way. Because he didn't think I would survive because I was a child, the youngest. INTERVIEWER: But I was really referring to the people that you were with every day. Did you talk to them about someday seeing each other again somewhere else, different circumstances? Did you ever discuss or-- or in any way talk about that? SUBJECT: We did. Our hopes were there. But yet, we didn't dare hoping, really. Because, as I say, when you see death on daily routine all around you, you don't think so far ahead. You think only in terms-- how could I survive for the next day or so. Many, I remember one young girl. She was married to a dentist, new, married only one year. She said, you know, when I survive the war, I know how to be very economical. You can live on potato peels and survive.

Now my fear of going back there and not being able to come out again was so great that I didn't even go back to my hometown. I just sent a telegram to the Jewish community there letting them know I'm alive, in case a member of my family comes back home. But my only hopes were to come to the United States.

Did you ever hope to see her again? SUBJECT: I-- sometimes we would discuss that-- that maybe after the war we would meet. And she was originally from Krakow. She was about 22, I think. So-- and she had some kind of a disease as a child that made difficult for her to walk. Now the girlfriend that I was very friendly with was my age. She was 15. Her father was a rabbi. Her whole family was killed. And she was also from Krakow. When I first came to Krakow, I did look for some soul, somebody, even from concentration camp that I knew, to-- some familiar face. And I was told that my girlfriend, the one that was 15, the same age as me, [INAUDIBLE NAME], is in a children's home, an orphanage. So I went to visit her. And we did get together. Of course, she came out with tuberculosis. So they were sending her to a resort. But she had to stay in a TB, tuberculosis sanitarium until such time as they felt she was able to function again, you know, normally. So she told me about this girl, Lola, the 22-year-old. She told me that she survived. And she said something else. She said she came to visit her in the orphanage. And she said that every-- Fri-- she's going got with someone steady. She met a boy. And every Friday night that she lights the candles, she says a prayer for me because I helped her during that march. And we spent a nice time, of course. You know, that was already after the war. And we had such high hopes and plans. And she wanted to go to Israel once she is cured. And I wanted to go to the United States. And she asked-- you know, she was very much against it. She-- she felt very Zionist type. She asked me why-- why United States? There was no simple explanation. It's just that this country always fascinated me.

Because the seed of anti-Semitism that was sown there already by the Germans was left over. The Poles felt that too many of Jews returned from concentration camp. Can you imagine? Out of 3 and 1/2 million Jews, they think some less than 50,000 returned to Poland. I remember, even after the war-- when the war ended, in Mauthausen how bitter I was. Certain countries sent in trucks to bring the citizen, Jewish, of Judaic background back to their countries, except Poland. It was an indication. Stay where you are. We don't want you. I still found a way of getting back, because that was my only hope of finding my family. I knew that anything, you know, they would try to get back home.

What would you think? Would you be eager to meet her, to see them? SUBJECT: I certainly would. I would be very anxious to find out, actually, how they have managed-- how did their life treat them over the years. I accidentally came across someone who was with me in concentration camp. And strange thing is she doesn't remember me. I remembered her, but she didn't remember me. And when I told her. I remember-- I remember you. You were with your sister-in-law. You were so protective against her, her husband's little sister. She was also 15. And she says, that's right. And she looked, every thing I mentioned, she realized that I was there. But she did not remember me. She lives right now in Colchester, in Connecticut. Her husband just died recently of a heart attack. So I was very happy to see, her to see that she has two children. They were well-educated. She was happy that the life treated her not badly. Of course, I would love to see what happened. There are not too many remaining from our group, because you know the train trips that they were carting us from one concentration camp to the next, plus typhus or so, took a great toll of most of the girls. I remember when we started out from Plaszow, Poland in April 1944, there were about 3,000 of us there, maybe less. I will not exactly go there. But there were about-- between 2 and 1/2 and 3,000 people. After the war, from our group, there were about 180 that-- known to me, that stayed alive. INTERVIEWER: I pursue this question that, if you knew that the 180 were all going to gather somewhere, and you had an opportunity to join them, what would your feelings be about going and meeting them once again? SUBJECT: I would love to see them, as I mentioned before. I do not avoid the past. I do face it. Some actions or so are very painful to think about or to go back to. But this, you know, I would not mind seeing them again and find out how they are doing, what happened to them over the past 30 some odd years.

Or to this day, you know, there are plenty of times that psychologically, if I have some worries or something that goes wrong, I have nightmares about concentration camp.

But I did, then when we got to Germany, I also was hoping that the normal hopes of a young girl.

I would look at winter scene, and to me it would look absolutely beautiful, the snow, and the trees, and the ground, and my favorite season of the year. Because I never thought I would see another winter. So this was-- I lived in Bavaria in 1947, '48. And as I said, these things that I appreciated very much. Then, of course, things that I was always hoping for, like school, and-- not always did that they materialized after the war. I would ever-- I would get a course here, a course there.

That I might lead-- have a normal teenager's life. I had a phobia about it-- I didn't have any hopes for my mother. I knew that she did not survive. But yet, I deeply, secretly, I was always hoping, maybe by some miracle, she would be alive. I resented the few kids that I knew who had mothers who were hidden and underground, or if they were in some way disrespectful to their mothers. I felt very strongly, you know, almost a point of jealousy that they had a mother.

"], ["telling the children about the experiences she went through", "INTERVIEWER: Your son, your son knows about what happened to you. What are his feelings now? SUBJECT: Not in details, not in such details as I have mentioned here. My first reaction was I want to spare them from knowing about the past. But as they went along, and they learned in Hebrew school, and they have seen the film, Let My People Go, or so, each one of them would react differently and come home and ask questions. Susan, the oldest one, was always very inquisitive. And she would-- I remember when she was 10 years old, she came home. And the first thing that came out of her mouth was mom, is it true that my grandparents-- that lampshades were made out of their skins? And soap out of their fat? Or-- you know, these are the things that all of a sudden, they became aware of. This girl had nightmares for days afterwards. It hit her suddenly. Because while the other kids took it as part of past history, it hit her close to home. Because she realized, you know, that I was in a concentration camp. That her father was in a concentration camp. The uncles and aunts she has-- they were all in concentration camps. So she became very conscious of it. She wanted to know exactly, how did her grandparents die? What happened to them? The youngest one never asked any questions. But she came from school with red, swollen eyes, so I knew, you know, that it affected her, too. Stuart, when he was shown that film, came home-- as a matter of fact, my neighbor's daughter brought him home, Susie Goodwin. Very-- and walked with him. Because as much as he was ashamed to cry, he watched the film and cried. And afterwards, she mentioned to me that she says he was trying to-- not to show any emotions. He was embarrassed, because the other kids watched, and as I said, to them, it was only past history. To him, it was more than just history. To him, it was something that actually happened, home, that he lived with in the house. Then I started, more or less, telling them a little more and more about it. They became a little more and more conscious of it. They became a little more appreciative, as far as the parents. They were trying all throughout their life very hard to make up for the hurt and the pain that we had suffered-- suffered in our childhood. And to this day, you know, find that many times, like Susan, the oldest one, always ask me questions about what happened to this one? What happened to that one? She's pregnant, she expects a baby. So she ask-- asked me. You know, you had so many relatives that died. Who should I name it after? Tell me something about that person first. And I find that, to a certain point, I'm finding out now that it did affect the children. But they are a little bit more conscious, too, of what's happening around them. They don't take orders blindly. They question. They want to know-- why should I do that? What's the reason behind it? Of course, all the dreams that I had as a child I did transfer to my children.

SUBJECT: There were no facilities, none whatsoever in concentration camp. There were no books. Sometimes on a Sunday, we would sit around, young people, and discuss certain things, books that we read in the past. Compare the authors, ideas about those books, our own feelings. How did you feel about this particular story? I remember we were discussing Shakespeare's Merchant Of Venice, I believe. And I was very young when I read it. And the only impression it left, that story to me, is the fact that I found the anti-Semitic description of this merchant and automatically, I disliked him. I disliked all his books for that reason alone. And we were comparing it between ourselves and back and forth. And I remember this dentist's wife, who was in her 20s at that time, said these are the times that he write the material, when he was with in the times. I couldn't understand it. Times or not, I still felt that he expressed anti-Semitism in this particular book. INTERVIEWER: Can you describe this more fully? You're in a concentration camp. Who was there? Where were you sitting? Do you remember the day? And you're having this discussion about Shakespeare. SUBJECT: Well, we were not sitting. This-- I remember particularly the incident was in Plaszow. And we had bunks. But it was summertime on a Sunday afternoon where we were not working. And we were sitting and talking, and comparing, as I said, what we had read, the material we had read, and what we have thought about certain ideas. INTERVIEWER: Plaszow was a concentration camp? SUBJECT: Plaszow was the concentration camp outside of Krakow. INTERVIEWER: And you were talking with whom, sitting with whom? SUBJECT: It was a group of girls my own age or a little older.

They took young, beautiful girls and used them for German officers. This camp, they even pointed out to me, is the camp where they are using the girls as guinea pigs for medical reasons or so. It was each incident, each story, I would hear about those things left me completely drained. You know, I couldn't think at this point or dream, even. Because there was so much-- not only drabness.

We saved about two and a half thousand dollars for him to go into that business. And of course, he took a great chance and a risk. I felt this way, that if he fails, we will not have any more children. I would go back to work and pay up if I borrowed $1,800 yet too, I felt that I would go back to work and pay up, and the debts, and that's it, and start all over again.

They have to save it. Otherwise-- I felt this way and somehow transmitted it to my daughters, too. I could not be secure, unless I could put this $1 away a week.

Our money-- I made three packages of our money. And we hid our money. One package I rolled in a sack and buried it in a-- a patch, a carrot patch in the-- on the lawn, in one of lawns. The second part, I stuck it into the-- what, the umbrella-- JACKIE B: The umbrella stand. ANNIE C: --the umbrella stand. We had four umbrellas in the garden. And I-- one roll I threw in that stand. And-- and the third, we unscrewed the inside of the oven, the metal door of the oven, and we-- I hid the third part in there. And thence my husband screwed back the door. Goes without saying, I never use that oven again. But we had-- we had another oven that we burned wood and coal. We had central heating. And we couldn't get wood or coal, so my husband had 200-- 200-year trees cut down and cut up. And we had enough wood for burning. And he gave the poor families some wood so as they could use it for their use.

So my neighbor said, Mrs. Colbert, what are you doing? I said, didn't you hear the bell? He said, Mrs. Colbert, go back to bed. That was the alarm clock going off.

He said, Mrs. Colbert, what are you doing? I said, didn't you hear footsteps outside? He said, Mrs. Colbert, go back. You're in safety. That was me walking the dog to make his wee wee. So I went back to bed. The next day, I took the bicycle and told my-- he said, tell your husband that he can come and sleep here too. He'll be safe here because my husband wasn't very happy where he was hiding. I told my husband that. And he said, he's not coming to sleep there. And he told me to not to go back.

And he slept in woods, or he had the bicycle, and he slept in the woods all over. And the peasants would give him-- gave him this suit and would give him a little food, money. So my husband took him-- brought him home. I gave him a good meal.

And they were sent in to the Germans, all the five in the town house. They had them all over. And we had Jew in French, Juif, they made us wear. So the brothers, every Jew was in danger, everyone. So this one wanted to hide out in our place, that he was taken after he slept over one night. Another brother hid in the-- when they came home, they told him to go down the cellar and hide out because it-- the Germans were around. He said, no, I'm not-- I have nothing against me.

He had left his papers at his mother-- parent's place. So the police said, go and fetch them. They meant for him to hide out.

ANNIE C: We have people suffering-- is sick with chol\u00e9ra to keep the Germans away. Anyway, that's just one of the I-- things that I want to tell you. And then later, the American hospital moved. In the American hospital, there were about 30 Jewish women hiding out. And I thought that dreadful to see them, that women of all ages hiding out in that hospital. When the Germans-- when the Americans moved their hospital out of our town, I got letters through the American Embassy. The wife of the Mr. [?

"], ["trying to get false ID's", "Then we said, we cannot stay here any longer. We must prepare to leave. But every person that we asked for false identity cards, we had no confidence. There was a doctor, a well-renowned doctor, in Paris, a very expensive doctor, that people knew that he made false papers for Jews, rich Jewish people, to get them out of the country. He'd help them out of the country. But he said they should bring all their money, all their jewels, all their riches to him, and he'll get them out of the country. They came to him in all confidence. And he had to examine them first. And on the-- where he examined them, on the table, there was a sliding door into the cellar. And he just slid them into the cellar. And-- in lye. In lye.

When we heard all of these goings on, we said, it's dangerous to stay. We must prepare to leave. So each person we interrogated for false papers, we had no confidence. LAUREL VLOCK: How did you know about this doctor and the lye. How did you know about that? JACKIE B: How did you know? ANNIE C: Through the newspapers. JACKIE B: They published it in the newspaper. But he still, nevertheless, could-- ANNIE C: He was arrested-- JACKIE B: He was arrested in the end. ANNIE C: --in the end. But he had done away with many, many rich Jews. We didn't go to him. We were not amongst that rich Jews-- happily. And so in the end, we were told to-- to gain Spain or Switzerland. And from Spain, we could get to America. But we had no confidence. People were done away with in the trains all over. There were terrible things going on, terrible. I can't explain everything. I'm-- I'm writing a book, which I take time to remember all the things that happened. Now, one of the men from the town house in our town came to our house in which we had the confidence. And he made us a false-- false identity cards. And our name became Monseiur Madame [? Frauge ?] no more Colbert. And we asked-- he knew of-- of a man that worked in the railways-- on the railways in New Orl\u00e9ans. He said, he'll take us to that-- we should go to that man in New Orl\u00e9ans. And he'll get us across the-- the-- the-- the Germans were not on the other side yet. JACKIE B: It would get you across the border. ANNIE C: The border. So we asked him to take-- come along with us. We were afraid to travel. So he said, I cannot come with you. But my wife will come with-- will accompany you. And everything was a lot of money. The false cards, everything we had to pay for very much. The lady came with us to Orl\u00e9ans. And we came to this man. There was a guard on the railway station. We left all our money with a Mr. [? Berro ?] in Paris. We were recommended to him by my daughter's best friend, his parents. We gave all our money to him, and we left. "], ["escaping with false identities", "We arrived in New Orl\u00e9ans, and-- for my husband, the man dressed him up as a guard. And at night, he managed to get him across to Mont Laussane. For me, it was more difficult. We tried it about five or six times at night, at 12 o'clock at night, me holding him as his-- with a handkerchief around my head, a basket of food, and like a peasant. So I was his wife. And-- but we came back with heart beat every time because it was too dangerous. It was not in the station, but where the trains are stationed And the fifth or sixth time when we went, he had men that helped him in the compartment where there were crates, full of crates, where-- full of crates. The men frayed a little space to the end. There was a door on this side, and a door on that side. And he knew where the train-- so they made a place for one chair. And we sat on the chair. I sat on his knees. And we were supposed to stop in Vierzon, a station called Vierzon for 20 minutes. As the trains stopped, the Germans-- as the train stopped, we held our breath back. And the least movement would-- the crates would make a noise. And there were Germans. They opened the doors where he knew they would-- the Germans. And they'd pass by and inspect. And very often, they'd have dogs. But happily at that time, they were not dogs because we just felt that we were there. Any way, the train, instead of stopping 20 minutes, it stopped two hours with our breath held back. Thank God when the train began to go, we caught our breath. The guard knew which side we'd arrived, which side was safe to go down. There was a door on the other side. So he-- while the train was going, he frayed a passage because the men filled up. When they frayed that passage for us, they filled it up with the crates. Then he had to fray a place for us to get off. Before the train arrived, we jumped from the train as it was slowing down because it was dangerous to get-- to get off in the station. When my husband-- when I met my husband in the station, he said, it's too dangerous for you to come to the hotel where I'm staying. There's raids every night. And with the old English accent, you'll be recognized right away. So he wouldn't let me go to his hotel. But he said, I'm going to see Mr. [? Berro's ?] wife and ask her if she can put you up. He took me to Mrs. Berro. And she said-- refused because she lived in an apartment where you had to go to the bathroom through the garden. And there were neighbors around. And if they saw a stranger, it would be very dangerous for her and for me. She refused. But my husband insisted so much, that in the end, she let me sleep over. At 12 o'clock at night, her husband arrived with the money. Half he gave it to me, and a half he kept to give to my husband in case one of us was arrested-- arrested. Oh, then we went into a hotel. "], ["taking along a boy", "And we had this boy-- the son of-- of the guard that was working on the station. His wife took a liking to me because I stayed two weeks before I left. And she gave him-- her son was 21 of age. And he would've taken by the-- being taken by the Germans for labor, forced labor. So she'd confided her son to me. And we took him along as a nephew. We were supposed to be his aunt and uncle. We paid his room, hotel, food, and everything. "], ["the boy falling in love and turning against them", "When we arrived there, [?

And I gave his mother my word that I'd take care of him. I felt very bad about it. And I didn't mention anything to my husband because he's out-- was outspoken. And I knew he would speak right out. I've kept it to myself for a long time. I suffered with migraines, but that's a different story. In the end, I told my husband. I told him what's going on. And I felt very bad about it. So he took the boy and said, well, that's not for you, that girl. She's so much older, and she's not strong. And we gave your mother our word that we would take care of you and you're doing wrong. So he promised us that it's not serious. But the father kept on telling-- when we spoke to the father, he kept on saying that it's really serious. So the boy took us-- boy-- the boy went against us. He became a-- what do call? JACKIE B: A blackmailer. He blackmailed you. ANNIE C: Blackmailed us in the end. And this Mr. [? Berro ?] each time-- we were owner-recommended. He was an honest man. He could have kept our money, and we couldn't say a word against-- a word against him. He was an honest man. But he told his wife that he's going to the woods to inspect the trees. He knew how old they were and the value of them. And instead of going to the woods, he came to Paris, and he had girlfriends in Paris. One day, the wife finds a letter in his-- in his pocket and finds out what he's up to. And she thought, being that we're from France-- from Paris, that we knew all about it. So she was against us, too. The daughter was very sad about the whole story. And she said, if it had happened to me, I wouldn't care. But my mother, she was very upset. Anyway, the mother and the boy became, instead of friends, they were against us. Mr. Bell-- we were staying in a hotel. Mr. Bell said, I'll find a place for you where you'll be happy. The Germans are not there. There's plenty of food. You'll be wonderful there. This boy, we had left in his home our ration cards-- the sugar, bread, tobacco cards. And with that, it was worse then without an identity card. And each time we gave him money, and he said he's going to Orl\u00e9ans, and he'll bring our papers. Each time, he made some other excuse. He was going to see this girl. We was in-- we were in that small place. The name is [? [ FRENCH] ?] 60 miles from Montlucon And we-- the first Sunday I arrived there-- it's a long story. You will permit me? LAUREL VLOCK: Yeah. ANNIE C: When-- when we arrived in the hotel, we had to fill a form and our name. I was Mrs. [?

I said, excuse me, but I had a dreadful headache, and I must lay down. Will you excuse me? I'd like to go up to my room. And I cut it short. In Montlucon this boy was traveling. We were paying his hotel, his food. And every footstep at night, we thought-- we didn't have a wink of sleep. We thought every footstep was to arrest us because he was making the black market. And he didn't tell us what he was doing. He took money, and he said, he's going to Orl\u00e9ans. He went to see this girl, And so it went on. So one day my husband says, you go and see Mr. [? Berrot ?] and tell him the whole story how he's treating us. So I said no, I'm not taking chances. It's very dangerous. There was a buggy next to the door with the two police always there. And it was very dangerous. My husband kept on insisting. I was the strong one. Although my husband was very, very clever, very clever. But I was a strong one. His-- in the end, he decided-- I decided to go. "], ["going back to get cards", "So I asked the hotel, the patron of the hotel to get me a big chunk of veal to take to my friends.

There was-- you had to steps up. It was 17 miles. The station was 17 miles from this hotel to take the train to Montlucon. We had to go through the woods. Arrived in the middle of the woods, two police stopped the buggy. Papers. The first three gave their papers and took it back. When it came my turn, I couldn't add, otherwise, I was brave. I gave mine, and I put my hand out to take it back. It's not coming. Every second felt like an hour to me. I never sweated more in all my life, being that I had that piece of meat and my false identity card. The-- the guard in Orl\u00e9ans, the woman that took a liking to me, put-- gave me Joan of Arc and put it-- the back of my false identity card to bring me luck. She didn't know exactly what I was hiding out for. My card didn't come back. I never, never sweated more in my life before and not since. Anyway, when he turned the card on the other side and the saw Joan of Arc, he gave it back to me. Were not Joan of Arc there, the man that made our false cards, that came to the house to make our false cards in the name of [? Frauge ?] he did not put my finger mark-- my finger marks on. And had Joan of Arc not been there, mine-- they would have arrested me. So Joan of Arc saved my life that day. When I got to the station, I said, I'm not taking the train. If I come-- oh, they asked me questions, and I answered them-- more then they asked me so as they shouldn't be too long asking me more. When I got to the station, I said if there's police that are smarter than those two, they'll recognize my accent. To take the train is very dangerous. To go back, there's a police in the woods. It's very dangerous, too. I sat on a-- on a seat, and I waited for the train to come in. And I was thinking, [INAUDIBLE], what is the best to do? I said, I'm not taking the train.

It was just second nature, because it had hap-- I had heard about it so early. And one day I had bought my mother a birthday present, a very beautiful vase. And when she picked it up, I realized that I had forgotten to pick it up and check whether it was made in Germany. And it had been made in Germany. And I remember that was crushing, because it was a beautiful vase and my mother had loved it. And then I know she felt very-- we both felt very ambivalent about it afterwards. And I've always kept that feeling about not wanting to have anything German. And as I got older, I try to, uh, balance out the views that there were some good Germans. And, uh-- but I wrestled with it for a very long time. And one day at a Boy Scout meeting of my oldest son, there was a woman who I heard speaking German. And there's just something about her. And I came into contact with her a little bit later, and I said-- before I knew what I was saying, she was a stranger in the community. She didn't speak much English. I said, well, why don't you just come over for coffee? And then I immediately regretted it. I said, this is ridiculous, for all these years, et cetera. But there was something about her. Anyway, she did-- I didn't follow it up, and I didn't call her. But after a while, I bumped into her in town and I said, well, you must come over. And there aren't that many people that I think that, uh-- that there's a real correspondence between the hearts. And I somehow-- there was a something special about her. And we talked on the same level, but it was very difficult. When she would leave, I would have all these feelings about, she's German. It was very difficult to deal with. And finally, I overcame it to a certain extent. And I see her often. She's a very good friend of mine. But she's still German. And she'll still be Barbara and German. And I don't think that I'll ever be able to, um-- it will ever be completely faded out. And her-- she has two boys my son's age, so I had to face what I was saying to the children about Germans. And here were two very nice boys whom they liked and who were not Jewish. And I had to sort of wrestle with the problem and put it in perspective, and yet tell them that, really-- that what had happened was of enormous importance and that it was something that, whether they accepted their Jewishness-- whether the boys accepted their Jewishness or not, this type of thing could happen again. And they were going to have no choice in it. And this was just something that they had to know. And they were going to have to make up their own minds as to how they felt about it, but that they should know that I felt very strongly about it. And when my husband wanted to buy a German car, he finally did. It was diesel, and he bought a Mercedes. But that will never sit right with me. And I feel that it's-- I'm just always aware of it. INTERVIEWER: Did you ever talk it through with your friend Barbara? JACKIE B: I did in the beginning when I've-- when I-- as soon as I could put it together. Because I could say that there were so many other attachments between us that, really, if I was going to continue, I-- I couldn't sit there thinking, yeah, she's German, every time I look at her. She's German. And, uh, I did. And she said, oh, you're Jewish. And I said yes. And this came-- actually, when it came about was that she had invited us to an Easter party. And so I-- I said yes, and I thanked her for the invitation. And I thought, I don't know how she celebrates Easter. Maybe she celebrates it in a very religious way. And since perhaps she doesn't know that we're Jewish, because we hadn't talked-- it had-- had not come out-- perhaps she would feel uncomfortable. So I called her up. And I said, Barbara, I don't know how you celebrate Easter, but, um, we are Jewish. And if you have a-- some sort of a celebration-- I don't know how you feel about it. I don't want to put you in an embarrassing position, because she was having other people, et cetera. And it was somewhat how-- that was sort of how it came out. So we talked. And, uh, that was the beginning. And she said, no, of course I didn't. Didn't mean anything to her. But then the next time we got together, later on in the week, we talked further about it. And, um, she told me her experiences during the war. Her father had been a very famous surgeon. And-- but for that they-- because of that, they had not starved, because he was very well-known and hid his family. And, um, so we did talk about it. And she could understand some of my feelings. And I don't really know what she thinks about them, really deep down. I think we have a very close friendship, but there's always that little something in my mind. But we did talk about it, because I couldn't go any further without talking about it. But I think of her as a close friend. SUBJECT 1: You must forget about it. I have many friends German. I had a neighbor. She was German. She was very, very nice. And I belong to a senior citizens group in Larchmont. And there are two German women that I sit with at table. They're wonderful.

INTERVIEWER 2: Did you have, uh, many friends or any friends who were not Jewish that you were-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: I had a few. Not too many, but I did have a few, yes. I will go into that later on as to what has happened. "], ["school before the war", "INTERVIEWER 1: Ralph, what was it to be in the morning in a Polish school? What was the class like? And when did it end in the day? And how did you get to the cheder? RALPH FRIEDMAN: During those days, when I was going to school there, the anti-Semitic feeling was already quite obvious. Some of the Jewish boys and girls were congregating on their own, had their own groups, and the non-- the gentile boys and girls formed their own groups. There was not what I would call exactly a friendly type of an atmosphere in that school. INTERVIEWER 1: How many Jews were you in a class? RALPH FRIEDMAN: In my class, there must have been about 10 or 12 approximately. In a class of 40, I would say a third, maybe a little bit less than a third ratio. INTERVIEWER 2: Could you-- would you mind saying that again-- the 10 or 12-- I mean, f-- 10 or 12 what? And-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: 10 or 12-- INTERVIEWER 2: No, start at the beginning, if you don't mind. Just say, in my school, there were 40 people. 10 or 12-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: In my school-- in my class, actually, there were about 40 people, 10 or 12 of which were of, uh, Jewish origin. And then the morning session was preoccupied by studying obviously Polish, and Polish history, Polish language, mathematics, geography, and all these other little things. And then I used to come home from school, change books, and run-- literally run to the cheder. In the cheder, we had about 8 or 10 boys primarily. No girls attended a cheder during those days. Where we studied Chumash, Tanakh, Mishna, Gemara. We studied the-- people call history. It was taught to us by a gentleman who was about to become a rabbi, who was neither here nor there, but he knew his-- obviously his material. 1939-- INTERVIEWER 1: In-- in-- in the morning, in the school, uh, when you learned history, or when there were religious hours, how were you treated? What was the-- were you Poles, Jews? What happened during hours of religious teachings? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Religious teachings-- there were no such a thing as religious teaching. There was only the religious prayer early in the morning, where the non-Jewish kids did not participate in it at all. They just stood there. INTERVIEWER 1: They stood up. RALPH FRIEDMAN: They stood up during the actual prayer. INTERVIEWER 1: Which was? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Which was a Polish type of a prayer. INTERVIEWER 1: Do you remember the Polish prayer? RALPH FRIEDMAN: I-- not quite. No. "], ["increasing antisemitism before the war", "1939-- talk began in our community about the incoming war between Germany and Poland. Prior to that, however-- prior to '39-- September, '39 it was. The atmosphere of antisemitism had increased immensely. We used to get up in the morning and find caricatures-- very unfavorable, demeaning type of caricatures of the Jewish people, which were posted on some of the telephone poles, some of the walls and windows of Jewish establishments, criticizing the Jewish people, especially criticizing the Jewish merchants, picturing them as vultures, picturing them as leeches and snakes. What we used to do is peel them off as quickly as we used to see them, and then within a matter of hours, they used to reappear again. The authorities-- the police authorities, the city government did absolutely nothing to discourage anything like that, which made us to feel that they are definitely in favor of something like this. This is before the actual shooting had began, and obviously the feeling after the war broke out-- the feeling of the Jewish people in all those communities, and cities, and towns was that this was a preparatory trick by Hitler to divert the minds of the Polish people-- the Polish population, the Polish natives-- divert them from the incoming disaster that he's about to throw upon them in the form of a blitz. INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember your young-- CREW: Sorry. INTERVIEWER 2: You were a young child, but do you remember any activity, conversation from the Jewish community as to what they could do about this discrimination. RALPH FRIEDMAN: I certainly have. I certainly do remember.l I remember a committee being formed that went to the mayor of our town, and, uh, the mayor was very receptive, very wonderful, smiling, and immensely promising about correcting whatever had to be done, not to fear anything, that he will take care of things. It was never done. It was just a matter of, uh, a pushover thing, or as we call it here, passing on the buck. Nothing was done in order to curb this influx or spread of antisemitism. Since nothing was done, then they went to the second stage, and we're talking about those young-- they used to call them endecks. We used to call them endeckis, endecks, endecks, endeckis, something like this. They started physical abuse. They caught the rabbi by going from shul one time. Two held him, and a third one was cutting his beard off with a knife-- with a dull knife, just simply cutting-- cutting the poor beard off, OK? INTERVIEWER 2: Did you see that? RALPH FRIEDMAN: No, I did not see that. I saw the rabbi afterwards. After the thing was done, I saw him without the beard. "], ["fear", "INTERVIEWER 1: What crossed your mind? RALPH FRIEDMAN: I beg your pardon? INTERVIEWER 1: What did you think of seeing that? The rabbi? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Uh, a fear. A slow developing, growing, emotional disturbance as a little boy. I remember wherever we used to see a bunch of other Polish boys sitting around someplace at a corner, or standing at a corner, we used to avoid walking by that corner, or take another exit or detour from the area. Since all these preliminaries were not curbed by the local authorities, they began a more extensive type of a destructive drive by breaking windows in stores-- Jewish stores, Jewish markets, and then breaking windows in Jewish homes. Simply as soon as evening arrives, you were never certain whether your windows will survive through the night. And then, the war. "], ["the Russians occupying Poland", "September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and, of course, Germany and Russia had made this subdivision type of a pact. One swallowed up one portion. The other one came to the other part, the eastern part of Poland, which fortunately, at that time, we had fallen under the Russian occupation. "], ["under the Russians", "INTERVIEWER 2: What did you see? What did you hear? RALPH FRIEDMAN: At that time, I recall that I was very happy and very proud, obviously, and all the residents of our community-- that we were fortunate enough to fall under the Russian occupation since they were not as severe in those days as the Germans were. Uh, on the contrary, the Russians had come in and had made everyone feel equal. Antisemitic slogans, and antisemitic remarks and discriminations have disappeared almost overnight-- immediately. INTERVIEWER 1: The Russians could, uh, restore the order, which the Polish authorities could not. RALPH FRIEDMAN: They had restored the order immediately within 24 hours. INTERVIEWER 2: Did you talk about this with your non-Jewish friends from school? Do [INAUDIBLE]. RALPH FRIEDMAN: Yes, those non-Jewish friends from school who were sort of like on the borderline of anti-Semitic, non anti-Semitic in those days had become very, very close good friends of mine-- a lot closer because of fear that they head for the Russian occupation and the Russian military. They were afraid, at that time, that they will be exposed as antisemites. And therefore will be severely punished. The way the Russians used to punish in those days-- they used to pick up those who were unfavorable to them and make them disappear overnight without knowing how, where, what, when. That's it. Exile. And most exiles went all the way to Siberia. So therefore, all my non-Jewish friends who were not too favorably inclined towards me personally before the war had become extremely close to me, extremely friendly, and extremely helpful in every conceivable way. INTERVIEWER 2: What did you talk about? Do you remember? RALPH FRIEDMAN: At the age of eight, child talk mostly. However, growing up, child talk, because of all these political events that had occurred within this time-- then going back to the Russian schools, and learning how to speak Russian, and become influenced by the Russian brainwashing and form of government that they have. However, I do remember that it made us feel so very free in terms of expression, in terms of walking at night without fear whatsoever, in terms of being literally liberated from the antisemitic atmosphere that we had lived under prior to '39. INTERVIEWER 2: Do you remember any incidents? RALPH FRIEDMAN: During the Russian occupation? INTERVIEWER 2: Yes, things that happened to you-- at home, on the street, in school. Any special incidents. RALPH FRIEDMAN: Nothing specifically that I could really pinpoint. The only thing I do know is that we were very happy. INTERVIEWER 1: And what kind of games did children play in that-- in those days? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Well, obviously, the Russian authorities-- the educational authorities had began imposing their type of educational system upon the schoolchildren in the form of-- like we have here Boy Scouts, they had the pioneers. And everybody had to be a pioneer walking around with a little red scarf and a little star-- red star, and special uniforms, and preaching the Russian constitution. You're supposed to have known this by heart immediately, the learning of the Russian language, the intensity of it, and then, of course, the political meetings that I do recall very, very vividly. Those used to be held, uh, in the market-- marketplace, usually on the outside in open air. They used to build some kind of a large tall pedestal where the Russian commissar used to come in, and the Russian police in those days used to round up all the residents all the people from the town in a friendly manner. Knock on the door-- come on, come on. We have a meeting. We have a meeting at the market. You must go. You must go. You have to listen. And this is how they used to gather us-- all of us together. This is the Jewish people, the non-Jewish people. Everything had become sort of like one unity, one unit in a unity way. And then, of course, there's communist propaganda, and Stalin was obviously the god of gods in those days. And at the end, he used to sing the Russian national anthem, and that was it. The thing that impressed me as a little boy was the movies. In those days, there were still silent movies. And those movies were free. You were able to walk into the clubhouse, which we had only one clubhouse in town, a large one, which would accommodate approximately 500, 600 people. No chairs. There were no seating arrangements. It was all standing so you could get in more people into the area. And we used to stand and watch the movies free. Then they used to serve beer to the adults free. Nobody had to pay for anything. And then this is '39. "], ["the KGB's filtration process", "1940-- this is when the KGB began their filtration process. By the filtration process, I mean that they had lists of names compiled, given to them by their secret communist agents who lived in Poland before the war, uh, and they used to come in at night, pick up the family or families, put them in wagons. Not automobiles, just plain, ordinary horse and buggy, but large wagons drawn by horses-- driven by horses. Used to take them away. Give them like one hour time to compile their belongings and take them away. None of the Jewish families in our area were disturbed or touched at that time. However, later on, very shortly before World War II, before the actual blitz of '41, they started removing some of the Jewish people, also. And those they had chosen were, uh, the business people who had larger businesses, who had employed non-Jewish people prior to that, who were a little wealthier than the average resident of the town. They used to take those also and take them away. None of those who were taken away were ever heard from to the best of my knowledge. They took away also one of our one and only female physicians, who was an excellent physician. She had married a Polish man. She was of Jewish extraction. She had married a Polish man, but she was the one and only physician in the entire town that I lived in. And they took her away, and they sent her away someplace. Her name was Glubowski-- Dr. Glubowski. Never heard from her again. "], ["brainwashed by the Russian communism", "We became a-- became accustomed very much to the type of life and the Russian communist doctrine, especially as a child, with this constant brainwashing in school about the greatness and the wonderfulness of the Communist system, and Karl Marx, and Engels, and-- and Stalin, Stalin, Stalin all the time. Our father, our teacher, our lord, our god, our creator-- Stalin. That it had become a part of me-- I actually felt that this is the only type of a system that I should be living under, that this is the only heaven on earth, because there is no better or other place in the world. This is the feeling that I had. INTERVIEWER 2: Your family-- did you discuss this? RALPH FRIEDMAN: My family felt entirely differently about that, but their intense focus was primarily on the youngsters-- boys and girls. Now, since I was only very young, at that age, they had placed me in the pre-Komsomol, which is the communist youth organization. The pre-communist youth organization was the Pioneer group. Well, I was a Pioneer, and eventually, if I had lived longer and the war had not broken out, I would have to-- I would be compelled to join the communist youth organization, et cetera, et cetera, and then progressively. "], ["rumors regarding the German invasion", "June 22, 1941-- it was like a blitz, not only in the physical reality, but also in the mental credibility. People just could not possibly believe that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union at such a point. INTERVIEWER 1: What did you see, think, hear? RALPH FRIEDMAN: We heard that there is a war, and we began hearing rumblings of planes in the air. We didn't know whose planes they were, but they were just passing over our heads-- high altitudes. And then, of course, the communication system in those days was very poor. There was maybe one or two telephones in the entire town which were placed in the post office and perhaps in the police station. OK? That's all. There was-- if there was one or two radios in town-- in the entire town, that was a lot, and the type of radios they had were those that you had to put the crystals together-- a tiny little needle with a crystal-- and then find the station, if you did find it at all. But the rumors kept on going, and whoever wanted to say anything at all just started spreading the rumors, and the fear began mounting. "], ["the German invasion", "But when we began to see-- this is June 22. I would say within two days, by June 24, we began to see portions of dismantled, or disrupted, or-- or destroyed Russian divisions that began moving eastward by every conceivable means of transportation-- by broken down trucks, by, uh, horses-- horseback, by foot. The Russian soldiers were just moving east, escaping from the German onslaught. "], ["fear", "And obviously, knowing the type of an attitude that the German people-- the Nazis, in reality, had towards Jews, our fear was mounting by the hour. We, in reality, didn't know what to do, except try to escape. Some youngsters from our town with their families moved with the Russian columns, who were intercepted later on, by the way, by being cut off by some of the advanced German Panzer groups. Most of us had left everything in the Lord's hands, and we began looking for and making some type of hiding places, hiding areas. INTERVIEWER 2: Describe that activity-- what you were doing, looking for hiding places. RALPH FRIEDMAN: OK. I felt like I grew up overnight. I felt like I was 35 or 45 years old. My mind was percolating continually in terms of survival, in terms of safety, in terms of hiding some of our possessions and some of our goods that we had. Hiding places-- and the hiding places were being made with the thought in mind not as much from the Nazi soldiers, because they were just passing by. The fear was that the anti-Semitic people in town would start before the Nazis would, and in reality, that's exactly what happened. I personally myself-- all by myself at that age-- I was about eight, nine. "], ["building hiding places", "I built a double attic right through the night, through the day. My mother was holding a candle for me to see what I'm doing, and I built a double attic in our house large enough to hide four or five people, and it was masked in such a way that no one would ever be able to find it just by trying to find it. It was a total impossibility. It was done in such a way. The second area I built in the same house was a double wall, where we could slide a panel and get behind the wall just wide enough to stand there in the event somebody would come to look for us. The third one-- I built an area in the basement where we kept our potatoes. In those days, we had tons of potatoes harvested from our garden in the back, and I built a hiding place behind the potatoes. In other words, that's all I had to do-- is just slide the tiny little board from the side, crawl underneath, and potatoes were in front, and potatoes were on top, and potatoes were all around. OK? Those areas were made in-- for-- for one specific reason-- several areas of the house-- that, in case we are caught for the sec-- for the s-- split second at a specific area of the house, the closest hiding place would be utilized immediately. So it would not be only one. For example, if I was downstairs in the basement area and an SOS goes through the house-- so whoever is in the attic area would go to the attic hiding place. I would run to the basement area. Someone else from the family would run behind the wall. It-- it was not one place so just to as avoid panic and pushing one another, and therefore destroying some of the masking on-- on the hiding areas. "], ["the corporation of the Poles with the Nazis", "About four days after, the first German patrols passed through our city. The moment the patrols came through and kept going ahead eastward-- the patrols were composed of two motorcycles and one armored vehicle. That's it. The moment that the antisemites-- and I call them to endecks-- they-- they saw the German soldiers and the German war machine in our town. Immediately they had chosen themselves to become policemen. And one of them was one of my best friends, a Jewish boy who studied with me, who slept in our house, who ate our food, drank our milk. Immediately he put on a shoulder band, or a-- what do they call that? Armband-- with the swastika. Black, red, and white. Got himself a rifle. He and maybe about four or five others went to our neighbor who was a math teacher by the name of Morris Solomon. Came to his house, took Morris out in the backyard, and shot him through the head. That's an ex student of his. INTERVIEWER 2: Did you see that? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Yeah. I saw it because it was a neighbor. It was in the backyard. INTERVIEWER 2: Where were you? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Pardon me. INTERVIEWER 2: Where were you standing? RALPH FRIEDMAN: I was already standing in one of our foyers, which had a little window in it, and I was watching it. He brought with him his own dog, this policeman by the name of Kuchinski-- Joseph-- Joe Kuchinski. He was all but 13 years old, 14 years old. After he shot Mr. Solomon, his math teacher, he somehow turned around to his own dog that he-- that came with him and shot the dog right there also just for the sake of shooting. On his way back, he came to our house asking for me, and my mother told him that she didn't know where I was. I must be someplace in town. When am I coming back? Well, I was behind the wall already. I was listening to everything that he was saying, but I was behind the wall hiding. When I was coming back? She didn't know. So on his way out, in the foyer, there was my bicycle. And he took the rifle butt and smashed the wheels of my bike completely, totally-- totally destroyed my bike and walked away-- walked away. INTERVIEWER 2: Your mother-- did she say anything to you? RALPH FRIEDMAN: No. No. Then this boy had become actually one of the executioners in our town. That's all he was doing. Then when the ordnance came out to start wearing-- INTERVIEWER 2: And-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. INTERVIEWER 2: What did-- what did you feel about your mother being terrorized by a 13-year-old boy that she had fed and helped? RALPH FRIEDMAN: I did not feel anything about my mother at that time. I just felt that we are in a squash, that our lives are hanging by a thread, that chances are we would never survive. And I personally would blame the local population for the executions and the destruction of the Jewish people in the surrounding town, surrounding areas. If they did not do it themselves before the ersatz (Einsatzgruppen) and the Nazi SS ersatz group (Einsatzgruppen) used to come in, they did not do it themselves, then they used to point out to those groups as to who should be eliminated. "], ["the German orders regarding the Jews", "And then a garrison-- a German garrison was established in our town. The lieutenant of that garrison was the boss of the entire little town. He, in conjunction with the local police, the corroborators-- and there were so many of them it was unbelievable-- had given orders for them to-- for the entire non-Jewish population to come in and just take anything they wanted from the Jewish homes, Jewish establishments, Jewish, uh, uh, stores, and businesses, and everything else. Just-- just take it. Take it. Take it away. And then they organized the forced labor groups. The ordinances used to come out every single day something new. The Jewish star had to have a specific size, dimension, color. At first, there was only one star, which you were supposed to wear on the shoulder on your left front. Then they came out the following day with a new order. The star has to be worn on the back, also, so many centimeters in width, so many centimeters in the length, and it had to be sewn on-- not pinned on, but sewn on on every garment. I had seen one Nazi-- let me retract myself. "], ["forced labor", "The first thing they did with the Jewish people-- boys, girls, women, whoever they could get a hold of-- is round them up into a forced labor battalion. Since there really was not much to do physically, they made us clean the grass between the cobblestones in the street. It was not paved streets like we have here. There were cobblestones laid, and obviously grass used to grow in between them, OK? We had to take our own forks and knives from home, come in, and just clean out all the grass with the roots and everything else, and sit on the ground all the time, and do this. In order to get to that place, we had to march like a column in twos-- two people-- front march like a column towards the street where we were doing the grass rooting up in the road, actually. I have seen an SS Nazi take out his pistol and use one of the stars on the back of an old Jewish lady as a target area. And he fired. Obviously, he did not kill her instantly because it was in the shoulder area, but her shoulder was disrupted. She was killed later on because she was of no more use to them. She couldn't come into work. So they took her out, and they shot her in the back-- backyard. "], ["taking away the Jews' possessions", "OK, 1942, Yom Kippur day-- oh, yes, retraction. Immediately, the German form of government had put on levees upon the people of our town-- taxes in the form of all possessions, and the first thing-- everyone had to bring in all their wedding bands, all their gold, all their jewelry, everything they had. Bring it into the police station and deposit it there. Secondly, they required boot-- boots, all kinds of boots. Any type of shoe-wear, footwear, anything at all had to be brought in. Thirdly, any type of warm blankets, and-- and pillows, and pillow cases, and linen. All of that had to be brought in and deposited at the police station. INTERVIEWER 2: All of it? Some of it? RALPH FRIEDMAN: All of it. You had to bring in everything. "], ["Judenrat, a Jewish community selected by the Nazis", "Then they have selected a committee among the Jewish people in town. That committee was responsible for all actions, and reactions, and orders to the remaining population-- the Jewish population of the town was transmitted by-- the German in charge of the town at that time was transmitted all this information through the Jewish committee called the Judenrat. Now, this was a compulsory service. Whomever they had chosen had to serve on this committee, and you had absolutely no way of getting out of it or saying no. A very specific incident that I recall right now that I had witnessed-- during one of those meetings one time, the meetings of the Judenrat, the Jewish committee in town, where those demands from the German authorities was discussed-- how are we to meet those demands? Because those demands were placed in terms of numbers. We need so many numbers-- pairs of boots. We need so many numbers of blankets. We need so many numbers of cushions, and pillows, et cetera. We just didn't have it, which meant we had to go to the non-Jewish people, to the farmers and trade something else with them in order to get the numbers of blankets to fulfill, for example. During one of those discussions-- I don't know how-- I got into the same room where the meeting was, and nobody, of course, had paid attention to me at that time. And I was listening, and listening to the bickering that was going on. It was just an impossibility to achieve the goal set by the German authorities as to how much and how many items we were to obtain for them. At that time, there must have been about eight or nine policemen only in our town. Most of them were not experienced. Most of them were white Russians and Polacks-- Polish people, the policemen. And I subconsciously came over to the table where the committee was sitting, and I said in Yiddish, why can't we jump all those policemen, take away their eight rifles, and escape into the forest? INTERVIEWER 1: Could you say it again in Yiddish now? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Absolutely. [ YIDDISH]. And the chairman of the committee, without saying one word, walked over to me and smashed my face. And my nose began to bleed. And he said, [YIDDISH]. You should never come out with this type of a statement or a comment ever, because I'll kill you. And that was it. INTERVIEWER 2: Could-- "], ["rounding up the Jews", "RALPH FRIEDMAN: Sunday, Yom Kippur day, 1942-- they began the round up of our town. They rounded up whoever was available. Whoever had a place to hide, hid. I was caught in the round up, and they took us to this public club, the one and only in town, and they locked all the doors and windows. And we were just sitting there not knowing what will happen to us. And then, of course, many people said, well, we're being transferred to a ghetto. The others said, no, we are being transferred to a labor battalion. The third one came out with an idea. Well, they're just holding us for some kind of a ransom. Maybe they want some of our goods. Maybe they want some of our hidden things that we have. Maybe they want our possessions, our diamonds, our jewelry, our wedding bands, whatever we might have. They're doing this just to frighten us. Now, these were men, women, children-- 160 altogether. I believe it's 160. Yes. Then they took us overnight-- we stayed overnight there. Then we were all horded out of the building and made to walk in the direction of a cemetery. I think it was either a Catholic or a Protestant-- I think it was a Catholic cemetery on the outskirts of town, which was about maybe a mile or so away from this clubhouse. When we came there, we saw a bunch of SS Nazis standing, joking, smoking, laughing, but they were there already. There was a bunch of shovels, and we were all-- especially the men and the boys-- were commanded to pick up the shovels. And one had outlined an area the size that he had chosen and commanded us to dig. The women and the children were left-- I would say perhaps maybe a block away from the area, and we were digging a pit. During the entire time of digging, I was absolutely deathly frightened, but at the same time, I did not lose my mental cool thinking and trying-- trying to figure out, how on earth can I get out of this? I could see it. I could see it very precisely as to what the result will be without any maybe [INAUDIBLE], without maybe God will help us somehow at the last moment. I was very realistic about it. When the pit was deep enough and large enough, we were commanded to get out. "], ["running away", "As I was crawling out of the pit, I picked up a shovel full of dirt-- sand, and I threw it right into the first Nazi's face. He was lighting a cigarette at that moment. His, uh, machine gun was hanging on his shoulder, and he was lighting up a cigarette. And I threw the sand right into his face, and it blinded him, and I started to run. And I ran in a zigzag so they couldn't take aim at me. They fired lots of rounds. There must have been someone else running behind me, because I heard a-- a shriek-- a deathly shriek like someone was hit by a fragment, or a bullet, or something like that. I did not dare turn around. I just kept on running. I got away. INTERVIEWER 1: Into the-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: Pardon me? INTERVIEWER 1: Into what? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Into the-- into the forest for the time being, because the cemeteries in Europe in those days were very bushy. They were not kept up like we have them in here. The-- the-- the deeper the-- the-- the weeds, the taller the trees, the unruly the bushes are, the better it was. It was like a-- a frightening area. A cemetery was always considered a very scary frightening area in Europe, yes. Some areas were almost impenetrable to walk through there, to look for some graves or anything at all. And this is why it was perhaps much easier for me to escape, to run away. After walking maybe perhaps a mile or so-- perhaps less, I don't know-- I stopped to catch my breath. I realized that there was nobody running behind me. And I sat down, and I cried. And I cried, and I cried, and then I heard the firing-- continuous firing, firing automatic weapons mostly, and then individual shots-- individual shots. Uh, more like pistol shots. And this is the grave that I escaped from, and this is the grave that I have here, that I had taken the picture after the war had ended. And this is what the grave looks like with or without me in it. "], ["a picture", "This is the only photograph in this world that I have or anyone else. There are no negatives. There are no duplicates. There are no nothing whatsoever. This is the one and only that I had taken with a borrowed camera. I had rounded up the remaining survivors. We came to the same grave, and I took this picture. INTERVIEWER 2: When? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Right after the war-- 1945. Now, I was looking at it this morning. There's an inscription here. May I read that inscription? And it was written by my mother, may she rest in peace, and signed by me, by my father, and my mother. And I'd like to read this in Yiddish, if I may. Dem kever hom for flantz tunzere sonim. Oyf morgen, noch Yom Kippur, neinzehn tzvey un ferzik (1942). Fun welchem s'iz gelongen zu antloyfen undz un andere fun oyfen bild.

In the center of the column, it says-- I'm sorry. "], ["the execution of 151 Jews", "I said 159 people in his grave. No, 151 people were executed in that grave-- that mass grave. Now, this came to me, and it was told to me by one of the white Russian witnesses. Since it was on a Sunday, and since the cemetery was not far from the church, right after the church, they all came to see the show of execution. And one of the women whom I had spoken to after the war had told me that there was a three week old little boy, which I know for a fact that the little boy was there because his mother, Mrs. Bloch, was a cousin of mine, and she just delivered a three-- three weeks before, she delivered a little boy. That little boy was left under a bush-- under a tree, and when the mother and the entire family plus all the other people who were in the clubhouse with us-- when everybody was executed, the little boy all of a sudden began to cry-- little infant. And there was a young Nazi that came over-- walked over to that little boy, took the tiny little infant by one of its legs, and walked over to a tree-- a large oak tree, and just smashed, and the little head just fell right off. Snapped right off. And threw it-- threw just the body without the head back into the pit. Now, one other thing, since it was Yom Kippur time and the weather begins to change in those parts of the world. At-- at night, it gets very cold, and the earth begins to freeze. The capacity of the grave was too large, or the grave was too small for the occupants, and therefore, after it was all finished and covered up, from what I understand, a farmer told me that from still the motions and the moving movements of the wounded bodies inside the grave, the top of the crust of the grave had opened up. There was like a crack, like an earthquake, like somebody was moving things under there, because the-- the-- the top-- the crust of the grave was not thick enough, being too small originally for the amount of people. OK. "], ["hiding in a farmer's house", "We did have several friendly farmers around our town and in our town who were very sympathetic, who disliked the Germans, who could see that first are the Jews, and then are the Polish people, and then are the natives, et cetera. And we had made arrangements with one of them that, in the event should we need a hiding place, we should be able to come to his place, to his farm. And he would hide us, and he would feed us for the time being. And for that, we gave him most of our valuables-- whatever we had. My mother owned a large size dry goods store before the war. She was the only one that ran that place. So most of the materials were salvaged and given to this farmer. My dad was-- besides being a Hebrew scholar, he was in the wholesale fruit business, but most of our possessions were in the form of dry goods-- all kinds of materials. And Poland being considered also one of the European textile production countries-- they produced a lot of textile, especially in the city of Lodz. It's a textile manufacturing city. We had given this man almost everything that we had with the idea that, should the time come where we will have to hide, that he would help us. And he did. And the hiding area was underneath a grain storage shed-- underneath the floor of that storage shed, which was approximately 22 inches high between the ground and the floor of the storage shed. They built those storage sheds-- the floors a little bit higher for the purpose of to prevent moisture attraction from the ground into the grain. My mother and I had crawled underneath the floor of that storage shed. We had to perform all of our physiological necessities in a lying down position. Lying down position only, because we couldn't-- 22 inches-- that high crawl space only. We were under that storage shed for five months. INTERVIEWER 1: Your father? RALPH FRIEDMAN: My father was taken away prior to that to a different town called Mejo to a labor battalion when we were separated. The war began going pretty well for the Germans. "], ["memories from the hiding place", "INTERVIEWER 2: What was it like inside that 22 inch hiding-- high hiding place? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Everything in the dark. Everything was dark. There was only one tiny little-- uh, one or two bricks from the foundation that he used to remove and just shove us our food in there, and then come back later in the afternoon and pick up the empty utensils. INTERVIEWER 1: Also, the-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: Once a day. Pardon me? INTERVIEWER 1: Did he pick up the waste? RALPH FRIEDMAN: No. The waste had to be left in a portion-- in a different portion of the area that we were lying in. INTERVIEWER 2: Could you get out during the-- any-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: No way. INTERVIEWER 2: You were there five months solid? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Five months lying down all the time. INTERVIEWER 2: Never-- never-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: Never out. Never see the light. INTERVIEWER 2: How did you manage? Do you remember it? What did you think? RALPH FRIEDMAN: Prayed. I repeated Shema Yisrael thousands-- maybe 10,000 of times continually, continually, continually. INTERVIEWER 2: Were you ill? Was your mother ill? RALPH FRIEDMAN: No. INTERVIEWER 2: You lay there for five months. How did you keep your body from-- RALPH FRIEDMAN: It was numb. I do remember a numbness. I will go into it in a few moments. When the war began looking quite favorably, uh, to the Germans and to the outside world, because the German armies were about to approach Moscow-- Leningrad was surrounded. And we used to get some information-- a little news from this guy, this-- this young fellow. By the way, this was a father and son only. No other people in the farm. No other members of the family, and he undertook this without the knowledge of his father. His father did not know that he consented to hide us underneath the floor and to keep us there. OK? Since he did most of the cooking-- all of the cooking for him and his father, and since he did most of the cooking for the pigs that he had-- the hogs that he was raising-- INTERVIEWER 2: Just continue, uh, Doctor SUBJECT: OK. We were five months underneath that floor of the grain shelter, or grain storage, uh, shed. The man who kept us there-- INTERVIEWER 1: In those-- SUBJECT: --with-- "], ["losing track of time", "INTERVIEWER 1: In those five months, did you sleep, dream? SUBJECT: Yes. We slept almost continually. We lost complete element of time. We had no calendars. We had no watches. We had nothing. If at all possible, we very little communicated with-- with-- with the man, with the farmer, because he used to do this very quickly. He used to take out the two bricks from underneath the foundation, put in the pot of food, whatever it-- there was there, and just close it up and walk away. There were times when we haven't spoken to him for weeks, not a word, nothing at all. And the thing that we used to hear were firing, some of the firing, and we thought perhaps it was by some of the Nazis-- Nazi command that was stationed not far from the farm who were doing some exercises, practice shooting. "], ["talking in the hiding place", "INTERVIEWER 2: Did you talk to your mother? Do you remember? SUBJECT: Yes, yes. Uh, we spoke to my mother, and we just didn't know when the end will be, and we lived only for the sake of hope, nothing else. "], ["nightmares", "INTERVIEWER 1: Did-- were there any dreams from that time that you recall? SUBJECT: Yes. I had-- I had-- [CLEARS THROAT] unbelievable almost nightmares where I used to wake up and scream, and my mother used to shake me just to quiet it down. And it-- somehow, apparently, it happened at night, or nobody hear-- heard us. It-- it was fortunate for us at that time. And the nightmares were because of that grave experience that-- the one I had escaped from. INTERVIEWER 1: You remember the content-- what was in the nightmare? SUBJECT: They were horror nightmares. There were, uh, hangings. They were, uh, butchering of-- of cattle. Uh, I remember, there was one thing-- a cat. We'd never had a cat, and I don't know what it-- what-- what it was like to have a pet cat. But I pictured a cat, somehow, and that cat kept on coming after me. And then somehow, someone had split the cat's, uh, belly open, and everything just fell right out. Things like that. [ SIGHS] "], ["the farmer starting to get scared", "The war began going pretty well for the Nazis. And the farmer became scared with the outlook towards the future. He could not see. He was hoping that the war would end, and the Russian armies would, uh, come back, that the Nazis would retreat back again, and he would be able to pull us out from underneath the floor and say, well, here we are, thank god. But things went in reverse at that time, and he became very despondent. He did not know what to do with us, because if we were caught underneath his grain storage shed, he would have been executed just exactly like we were, same time, same moment. Matter of fact, his father would also have been, who had known nothing about it-- completely innocent. He began thinking as to how to dispose of us. INTERVIEWER 2: How do you know this? And what was the smell like underneath that? I mean, you had no-- "], ["physical conditions in the hiding place", "SUBJECT: Since it was exposed with cracks in the foundation to the outside air, and the air was very cold at that time, there was very little smell. Whatever excretions we-- the biologic, physiologic excretions, we just dug a little hole into-- into the foundation-- into the ground, actually, in the sand, and just buried it and covered it up. And this is the only way. And because of the fact that it was during wintertime, during wintertime, everything was frozen, so there was no smell. Everything used to freeze, because the weather there is very severe in terms of cold temperatures, always below 0. Yes, we had-- we had a few of our blankets that we had given him to prepare for us. We had a few of our, uh, uh-- there were-- there were lamb coats, made out of lamb, lamb wool coats, and those are the only things that kept us-- kept us warm. And of course, two bodies' heat together-- we were lying together very close, my mother and I. "], ["farmer trying to poison them", "OK, um, how did we know he was trying to get rid of us? We began detecting pieces of glass in the food-- crushed glass. And the first piece of glass that I found in my food, I thought it was an accident-- something broke, and a piece of glass got in there. And then my mother found some more in her food, and I found some more in my food. And the following day, the same thing, and the same thing, and we stopped eating at all, entirely. We were accepting the food, and we were pouring it out underneath the floor without him knowing that we are not consuming it. "], ["leaving the hiding place", "And that is when my mother and I realized that something had gone drastically wrong, and that we must do everything we can to get out of there. And we have. On a Sunday, it was, and it was a blizzard outside-- actually a blizzard. And I got dressed in my mother's clothes-- a skirt, uh, boots, a very thick, heavy, large babushka over my head. And we broke through a few more bricks from underneath that wall, and I crawled out into the snowstorm. And when I stood up on my feet, my feet gave right from under me, not-- lack of use for five months. I just fell right-- INTERVIEWER 2: You must have been weak from no food. SUBJECT: Extremely weak, and mostly weak because of my muscular inaction. My legs were-- they felt-- I did not feel that I had legs under me. So I kept on walking, and falling, and walking, and falling, continually. But the urge, the impact to survive, in those days, in those moments, in those trying moments, are so great that it meant either life or death. If I was caught, obviously, I would have been executed. "], ["going to another farmer's house", "And I walked-- we decided to go to another farmer two miles away from the one that we were at. And I made it. And I did not go into the farmer's house, but I got into his barn, waiting for him to come to feed his cattle so I could make my first contact with him. And I was hiding-- hiding underneath some bales of hay that he had to feed the cattle with. And when he came in in the evening to feed the cattle, I got out. He got deathly frightened. He recognized me, and he said, what are you doing here? I don't want you here. I want you to leave immediately. I have a family, and if they'll catch you here, they will execute all of us. Don't you know what's going on? I said, no. They're executing everyone who has any type of contact or any type of assistance, giving any type of assistance or help to any of the Jewish people. I said to him, well, I have no place to go, and you have no choice. The only thing you can do is, you can destroy me, you can kill me if you'd like, but I'm not leaving this place. And since they are executing people who are hiding some of the Jewish population, the members of the Jewish community, then it would be to your benefit to hide me for a while until I can get a little strength in me so I'll-- could go away. I will go away, I promise you. But I cannot leave today. And if you should fail to do so, and if they should catch me and torture me, I will tell them that you kept me here. And he became very disturbed, and he walked away, and I was left in the barn with the cattle. About an hour later, he came back and brought me some black bread and a-- a-- a large cup of hot water-- no tea, no coffee, no nothing. There was no such a thing in those days, not during the war. And he must have seen how I gobbled it up, because he stood there just watching me. And he said, all right, you can't sleep here tonight in the-- in the barn. Come into the house, and I'll put you behind the large-- they used to have a very large baking oven where they used to bake the bread, you know, and-- and-- and heat the house with wood only. It was exactly like-- we have here those pizza ovens, but it was three times the size in length and height. But behind that, there was a little area, like a little nook, and that's where he hid me. And he kept me there-- kept me there for about five days. "], ["the plan to save mother", "INTERVIEWER 2: Your mother? SUBJECT: OK, my mother was left there. Thank you. Our agreement with my mother was like this. We began to hear rumors prior to my escape from underneath the floor that there is such a thing as a partisan movement in the area developing already. INTERVIEWER 2: How did you hear? SUBJECT: He told us. Our farmer, our original farmer, told us at one time that the shooting that we heard, like a week ago or so, it came from a group of partisans who just tried to shake up the German Garrison. It was not the German Garrison doing practice shooting. And this is-- this was our first knowledge and first-- I shouldn't say contact, but mental contact, if there is such a thing, with the outside world, realizing that there is someone resisting the Nazis, because for a moment, we gave up hope. We thought that they are irresistible, and nobody could possibly stand up against it. I decided before I left, mother and I, that as soon as I get to the second farmhouse, that I will write a letter in Russian to the first farmer telling him that I am out from underneath the floor and that I have joined the partisan groups who are composed primarily of escaped, uh, Russian soldiers who escaped from the German, uh, POW camps. Also, from some of the local people who were in great disfavor of the Nazi occupation, who had also joined the partisans, it was a-- a growing underground movement. And I had written to him in this letter that if my mother is hurt or harmed in any way from here on, that I personally will come back with the partisans. I will destroy his farm and destroy him. And I signed it, and I had the second farmer deliver the letter to the post office. So another two or three days went by. Apparently, he had gotten the letter, and he got frightened, because he stopped poisoning mother. This is after I had got-- My mother was there for about another two weeks underneath the floor, and also escaped, got out from underneath there in the middle of the night, and walked to this second farmer that I was still at. And this is how Mother and I got reunited back again. "], ["his mother's strenght", "INTERVIEWER 2: Was she-- was she fearful you might not still be there? Did she tell you she was worried after-- SUBJECT: No, no. She felt that I was still there because of the time element. If it was a little bit longer time elapsed between her getting out and my getting out, she perhaps would have been. But obviously, she was never certain whether I made it, whether I didn't make it, whether I was caught, whether I was intercepted. She never knew that. INTERVIEWER 2: Did she ever talk to you about her anxiety after all the two weeks? SUBJECT: No, my mother was an extremely strong individual. I don't know, obviously, how she felt inside, but she was always, always ahead of the family-- ahead of the family in-- in-- in the most horrifying moments. She was like the CEO. If it hadn't been for her, my father and I would not be alive today. There were several instances that-- where she gave the command, hide, there were no questions asked. Besides the fact, she was on the Jewish community of our town, simply because she spoke German very fluently. And if anyone had to go to negotiate with the Germans, they used to send her. And several times, one of the Nazis used to beat her up-- beat her up physically very badly, throw her out of the room. And she used to come back with nothing again. Mother and I were reunited at the second farmhouse. And then-- "], ["reunion with mother", "INTERVIEWER 2: How did she get in to find you where you were? Can you describe it? SUBJECT: Yes. She came to the farmhouse, and she came exactly to the same farmer, and she came in to the barn. And she-- again, she waited for the farmer to come in. She told him she-- they knew each other from doing business in the past. Told him that she knows that her son is here, and can he please bring me to her? And this is how he came and he told me, my-- your mother is here. INTERVIEWER 2: All this time, you are in that nook? SUBJECT: Yes. INTERVIEWER 2: Never out? SUBJECT: Never out.

There were no Nazis, or any one else in this respect, to go to look for any survivors. So everything was quiet. And he had calmed down his initial impact from harboring fugitives like us-- so-called fugitives. He became quiet. He became quite pleasant. He used to tell us some news. He used to have, uh, a third farm or some place where he had a little radio. He used to bring us some news and tell us what's going on as far as the Russian front is concerned, to tell us that the-- the Nazis are freezing there. And then he came and gave us a big, huge news about Stalingrad. And he even brought us a leaflet that was dropped by the Russian-- by a Russian plane to tell. And the leaflet looked like, 330,000 in black, with a red cross over it. And underneath, it said, in Russian, Stalingrad, 330,000 German troops were surrounded and destroyed. The command belong to General Paulus-- Field Marshal Paulus, one of the high German commanders. And it also gave the name of the Russian general who commanded the forces of Stalingrad, who destroyed the Nazis. His name was General Chuikov-- the Russian General Chuikov. OK. INTERVIEWER 2: Your mother and you are both behind-- in that nook now? SUBJECT: Yes, we are both together in the nook. And if there is someone-- now, his-- the farmer's family knew about it already. INTERVIEWER 2: Could you sit, stand? Describe the nook. SUBJECT: We could sit. We could get out of the nook and stand up at night only, when nobody was around, OK? Back into the nook again. We were fed about twice a day, in the morning and then late in the evening. And we stayed there.

"], ["the farmer's family", "INTERVIEWER 2: You started to say something about the farmer's wife. I-- I-- SUBJECT: The farmer's family was told about the fact that we are there. He had no wife, but he had three daughters. And the daughters were very receptive to our being kept by their father for the time being. And they did everything in their power to help us, to make us as comfortable as we possibly can, and to be with us, and to speak with us-- it was like an entirely different world compared to the under-floor hiding place.

INTERVIEWER 2: How did know you'd find them? SUBJECT: I didn't. I just went to look for someone, something. I used to stop at farmhouses, and speak to them in Polish, and ask them if they have heard of anything, of the underground, of anything like that-- INTERVIEWER 2: That was a risk. SUBJECT: --of the partisan movement. I had no choice. And then I came to one farmer, whose son had joined the partisans for no other reason because he wanted a thrill. That's all.

INTERVIEWER 1: As a Jew? SUBJECT: As a Jew. And then they all had a conference. They walked away from me, and they had a little quiet, secret talk. Came back, and they told me, they will take me to another group of people like me who live on an island. I asked them where, and they said, we cannot tell you that. It's a secret place. And I asked them how I can join the underground. And they said, you have to have a weapon. A weapon is the most precious thing. It's more precious than three or five lives-- one gun-- and you have to get one if you want to join with us.

Unless you knew where you were going, you would never return. However, this little road, which was built by the German World War I artillery brigade, who had to transfer some heavy artillery pieces to the island so they could fire strategically upon their enemy. So what they did, they had cut trees-- trees, and put them across, and made a little road, very narrow. Unless you knew where to put your foot on, you would sink right into it. We went to that island. And it was more-- more of a secure area. No-- no Nazis could possibly get to that place. It was an absolute physical impossibility, unless they had a guide to take them through that little hidden road or path. I lived with those people for about four days, and I decided, no, I have to go and get my own gun. So myself-- INTERVIEWER 1: How many of them were there?

So we did. We went to an open area. We walked into a farmhouse at night. I made a artificial type of a muzzle by burning a branch in a fire-- in a bonfire to make it look black, just to darken it. I put it-- put it like this under my coat, so the farmer at night could not tell whether I do have a gun or I don't have a gun with me. And we walked into this farmhouse, and we asked the farmer if there are any Germans around here. He said no. And I asked him in Russian, do they come here often? He said no. He says, but there is one that comes in to see one of the girls, my neighbor's girl. He comes like every single night around 5 o'clock. He comes here on-- by bicycle, and he spends the night here with her. And this is all we needed, my friend and I. And we waited several days and several evenings for this guy to ride on his bicycle. And when the time was ripe, we jumped him. And this is how we got our two guns. I got myself a German automatic weapon, and my friend got his pistol. INTERVIEWER 2: What happened to the guy? What-- when you-- SUBJECT: I don't want to go into that. He did not go back on his bicycle. Now, I was 10-- 9, 10, approximately. My friend was about 12.

And when I saw him, my first reaction was, where's my father? And he tells me that he saw my father being executed at the grave site. He saw it with his own eyes. And that's when I blew my mind. The first thing I started was drinking the moonshine stuff, very heavy. Used to go to a farmhouse, and the farmer had to prepare the moonshine stuff for me. I was a full-fledged underground fighter. Nothing was frightening to me at that point-- nothing at all. I think it was the false security of having a automatic weapon, which there were not too many. The farmer used to supply me with the whiskey. I used to get drunk, get back on my horseback, and the horse knew its way already back into the camp. After I heard the story about my father being executed, I jumped on my horse at night, all alone, rode for about 3, 4 miles, walked into the same farm, woke up the farmer, and my first word was, whiskey. And he was not fast enough to hand me the jug. And I let go, and I shot the whole ceiling apart with my machine gun until I saw that whiskey jug in front of my eyes. I almost emptied it, got back on my horse, and back into the camp again. And from there on, I was drunk all the time, to a point where the command of our partisan group decided to get rid of me, one way or the other. First, they were going to execute me, because in the event I am captured drunk and tortured by the Nazis, I would probably reveal certain things, places, hiding places, et cetera.

One incident, we were returning from a very successful mission one time, myself and another group of my colleagues. And, uh, we still had some explosive left with us. And one of the boys decided, well, why don't we have to-- why do we have to go this way back to the base? Why don't we go by way of another direction and see if we can maybe catch another train-- another ammunition train going to the front? And we did, and we found the railroad tracks, and we planted the dynamite with a long wire. We left our horses-- we were on horseback all the time. We left our horses in a distance in the little tiny forest area away from the track. And sure enough, and it was at night, the train was going by. We let it go through about halfway, in the middle. And we pull the fuse, and it was the most gorgeous spectacle I ever saw in my entire life. It was a spectacle that it was frightening, and at the same time, made me feel so good and so proud. Apparently, the train was not only an ammo train going to the front, but it also had an extension of live soldiers being shipped to the front. And everything just kept on blowing up like unbelievable-- like a 4th of July thing. It was an unreal thing. However, several of the cars had mounted heavy caliber machine guns-- .50 caliber machine guns on them. And they began firing just in any conceivable direction, just kept on firing. And then the firing stopped. But unbeknowingly to us, a group of their commandos who had accompanied the train had gotten off the train, somehow, in time, and had made a circle to surround the approximate area where they thought that the sabotage mission came from, meaning us. When we got finished, we got back on our horseback, and we were riding back in our direction towards our base, and that's when we ran into a trap that they had set for us. They opened fire. My horse fell, shot right under me. I fell, and I hit my head against something. I don't know what it was. This depression in my left cheek is not a naturally born dimple. This depression was created from that fall, because if I touch it right here, it's completely, totally numb. I can still take a pin or a needle and pierce it through, about a quarter of an inch deep, without having any type of sensation or feeling in it. Apparently, one of my cheekbones was traumatized from that fall, that knock. However, I blanked out. And I was pulled out by one of my-- my comrades-- pulled out of the battlefield. No one of our group got-- was hit or killed in the ambush, only my horse. And I cried. And I cried for that horse, because that horse saved my life many a times. It was a black stallion. I cried bitterly, came back to the base. This was one incident among many others.

And somehow, miraculously, and I still don't know how, she had found out where my father was. My father had escaped on his own from the labor battalion that he worked in in the town Myadel. And he was-- he escaped with another group of people simply because he was liberated by another partisan group, who was commanded by a Jewish major. And this Jewish major came in with his boys, and they had freed all those forced labor people, the Jewish people among-- one of them was my father. INTERVIEWER 2: What major-- Jewish major?

SUBJECT: They were both living, I would say, within the same area where-- approximately were our partisan base was, in the forest. But when she realized that my dad had escaped from Myadel from the labor battalion, she went, somehow, and she found him, and they-- they had gotten reunited, but they knew nothing about me. They didn't know where I was at that time. Someone told them that I was killed in action. On one of our returns from a mission, a very successful-- again, a very successful mission, we had intercepted a German convoy just at a specifically designated place that we had chosen to intercept them. And we demolished 16 trucks with-- with food, and gear, and ammo, and soldiers, and everything else. It-- it was a huge battle we had there, about four hours, four and a half hours. We were returning from this mission, and we came-- we were already in friendly territory. We knew where we were-- friendly territory, swamp area. That was most friendliest territory we've ever known. And we did not expect anyone, especially at dusk time, to ever be able to get to this place, unless you knew where you were going. And we made a little bonfire to bake some potatoes, because we were very hungry. And we were sitting and discussing the event, you know, and joking around, and talking a little bit. And suddenly, we hear, from the dark forest, crackling of twigs. When you step on a dry branch, it crackles. And we jumped, we extinguished the fire immediately, and we pulled into the dark bushes. And we were lying there, our guns cocked. And the steps were coming closer, and closer, and closer to the area where the fire was. Apparently, they had seen it from far away. When we felt they were close enough, I hollered out in Russian, hold it! Who is it? And they said, please don't shoot. Don't shoot. And we commanded them to walk into that little open area where the bonfire was. And there is my mother, my father, and another man, a neighbor. And I'm rubbing my eyes, because I thought my dad was-- was executed. They, the two of them, my mother and father, thought that I had died. And there we were standing, looking at one another, non-believing what we are seeing at all-- total mirage. And I thought it was a dream. And I kept on touching myself, is it me? And it was me. My mother was in shock. She lost her speech for about three weeks. She could not communicate. She must have had, maybe, a mild CVA, or I don't know what happened there, but she did lose her speech. She used to communicate with me by writing in the sand, you know, if she had to give me some kind of a message, or by way of, uh, showing, or by way of pointing things out. And that was the time when I stopped drinking-- not one single drop from there on, not until the war ended. And when the war ended, I got bombed-- bombed by way of whiskey. INTERVIEWER 2: You, at this time, when you were reunited with your parents, in a drunken state most of the time, were between 10 and 11 years old? Were-- were you small, were you tall? Describe yourself. SUBJECT: Tall, tall, I was tall. And this is why I was able to join the group of the underground, the partisans, as I have. They-- they thought I was 16 because of my height. I was very thin, and I was-- I commanded Russian very-- very fluently. And I was volunteering for the-- for the craziest missions there were. They needed me. But they were all under the impression that I was about 16 years old. INTERVIEWER 1: That reunion was what year? SUBJECT: The reunion? 1943. "], ["in another partisan brigade", "Then I had made a transfer to another partisan brigade-- different type of a brigade, where many of the people from the Vilna Ghetto had escaped and had come into the forest with us. They came with guns, because apparently the message was related to them somehow, from the forest into the ghetto, don't come to the forest without a gun. You're useless. So they did everything in their power to buy, steal, obtain weapons. Otherwise, they were not acceptable. Uh, mouths to feed, there were too many, and food was extremely scarce. And the partisan command was growing miraculously from practically nothing to thousands of people. We had our own cavalry. We had our own field kitchens. We have our-- we had our own hospital area. During the day, we even ventured to move into certain villages and certain towns without fear of being attacked by the Nazis, because the war machine-- the Nazi war machine had began to crumble. And then we began receiving supplies by air from Moscow, from Russia-- guns, cameras, food, medication, and messages. There was a message sent our contact in Moscow. "], ["the German Blockade", "Then the Germans had thrown what we call a blockade. And this is the blockade, apparently, that Mrs. Sasansky was talking to you about-- the German Blockade of 1943. The Germans, realizing that their position is becoming very vulnerable, in order for them to retreat in semi-peace, they decided to clear the rear of their retreat areas by eliminating the partisan groups. So what they did was, they had pulled away the third line from the eastern part of front-- the front line. There were three lines, 1, 2, and 3. They took the third line of the German army, and they made it march back to clear the way for everybody else, should they need to retreat-- should they be compelled to retreat, which they have. The message from Moscow came-- do not intercept-- this is to the-- all the partisan groups. Do not intercept the enemy-- forgive me. Do intercept the enemy on the small, little trails and small little roads of retreat. The large highways and the large transportation roads, they will be reluctant to take themselves. In other words, the Russian Air Force was plastering all those heavy, uh, and large highways, which were going from Russia back west towards Germany. So we had the assignment to intercept them in forests, in tiny little villages. And that's when everything had broken loose again-- all over again. But at that time, it was a large force of underground, of partisan movement. "], ["parents", "INTERVIEWER 2: Your parents were with you? SUBJECT: My parents, I had taken to a special island called Podlazie, where there was only one farmer and one farm. And the farmer was very sympathetic to the partisan movement. And he was the one that fed them. He was the one that housed them there, in a little foxhole that I built for them in a mountain. The mountain, we just excavated the inside of the mountain and built a foxhole in there, and that's where they lived. "], ["Jews amongst the partisans", "INTERVIEWER 1: In the partisan battalion org, how many Jews, or what weight did Jews carry? SUBJECT: OK, uh, there were several battalions. There were battalions where there were-- there was a mixture of Russian, Polish, white Russian, and Jewish fighters. There was a group which was strictly Jewish-- totally Jewish-- a Jewish battalion of Jewish partisan fighters, uh, with a Jewish commander, but under the supervision of a Russian colonel. In other words, this was only a battalion, and in terms of division, he was in charge. There was also a group created in the Jewish battalion called, in Russian, proizvodstvonaya grupa. That is a group which was composed primarily of tailors, bakers, uh, barbers, uh, shoemakers, who were fixing and supplying their skilled labor to improve and facilitate the rest of the partisan brigades-- to make their shoes, to fix their shoes, to fix their boots, and their zippers, and everything else. "], ["in the Red Army", "INTERVIEWER 2: You were this way, in the woods, fighting with the partisans, until the war was over? SUBJECT: 1945. Then the Russian command decided they have no more need for the partisans. And since most of them were trained fighters already, they infused all of us into the Red Army-- obviously, not in the same brigades of the Red Army, or platoons, or divisions. I happened to fall into a field military field hospital, and I was appointed chief of security of that hospital. And the hospital was near Grodno, which is in Poland-- Grodno, Bialystok, it's a large-- it was a large Jewish community in Grodno, but at this present time, was empty. And I became chief of security of the military hospital in Grodno. And then, this is-- the war still was going on. And then I don't know, and I still don't know to this day as to what has happened, but some German group trying to make its way back from the Eastern Front had jumped this military-- Russian military field hospital. And there was a severe battle. And that's where I was wounded. I was wounded, fortunately for me, within my appendix area by a fragment of a hand grenade. And, uh, our forces, apparently, had driven away this German group. And, uh, the only thing I can remember is, I woke up in the hospital after the surgery. They operated on me right there and then, and they removed the shrapnel. "], ["in Berlin", "And then, when the field hospital was moved into Berlin already, I was in Berlin, and I had the rank of a high officer at that time already. I was only-- how old was I? About 13, 14? 13, 13, 14, in this vicinity. [SIGHS] My parents, I got in touch with them, and they came to Berlin, also. Berlin was divided into a four-zone city at that time-- Russian, French, British, and, uh-- INTERVIEWER 2: American? SUBJECT: American. And we decided-- we found out that many of the survivors are moving towards the Western part of Berlin, which meant either to the British zone of Berlin or the American-- primarily the American zone of Berlin. And then, already, the Joint Distribution Committee had set up receiving camps in Berlin. And that's when I have decided to send my parents there. I came there myself for a visit. I shed my Russian uniform. I buried my automatic in a flower pot outside the window. I put on civilian clothes. And with the first transport from West Berlin, they took us to a displaced persons camp in West Germany called Eschwege. Eschwege was near Frankfurt-- Frankfurt am Main. INTERVIEWER 1: What was it like to be in Germany as a soldier with a weapon and see the Germans at the end of the war [INAUDIBLE] SUBJECT: I'll tell you, I had seen-- at that point already, I had seen so much bloodshed that there was no desire, no urge, no-- no-- no animalistic feeling to see any more. Obviously, the German people were are broken down, beaten people at that time. And this by itself made everyone who was against them feel good. Uh, the hunger, the poverty in Berlin was very, very severe. "], ["Judenrat, the brutality of the Red Army", "However, I have seen gruesome things inflicted by the Red Armies the moment they had entered German soil-- absolutely gruesome. I would not like to go into that, because this would not allow me to sleep for some nights again. I had questioned, once, a Russian captain, why he's doing what he's doing. And he started to cry. And he told me that he came to his hometown after the Nazis were driven out of it in the Ukraine, and he found his entire family-- his wife, his children, his parents-- dumped into a water well, deep water wells, while they were still alive, with their heads down. Now, this is a depth of maybe 15, 20 feet deep. That's a water well. But some of the Nazis had taken each member of the family, held them by the feet, and just dropped them in there. They couldn't move. They couldn't even turn around in there, because a water well is very narrow. And he saw them there when they died, he says, and then he went crazy. He says, he never took-- since then, he never took a German prisoner alive, regardless as to what the rules and regulations were. He never took one alive. He used to walk around with two submachine guns, one on each shoulder. [ SIGHS] All right, how much further do we go? INTERVIEWER 2: Several things. I know you don't want to describe what people behave like and what you saw, but people in the future have to know what the effects of atrocity and brutality-- outcomes. SUBJECT: It seems to me that if one is given-- and I'm speaking about the human race-- INTERVIEWER 2: Not in-- in broad, but in specifics, what you saw-- the kind of-- INTERVIEWER 1: Like the Russian captain. INTERVIEWER 2: You said you saw the Russians doing things to the German people that you didn't want to describe. I'm asking you to describe as best you can, without risking your own well being, because posterity has to know what war does to people and what brutality does to people. SUBJECT: I have seen Russians-- Russian soldiers actually carve the hammer and sickle on the back of an SS man after they had disrobed him and tied him up-- his hands and his feet-- with a bayonet, actually carve out a hammer and sickle on the back of the skin. I have seen SS men being hanged with piano wire by some of the Russian soldiers. But it still-- it is not compared to the type of atrocities that were carried out by the Nazis, by the SS men upon the Jewish people. "], ["hunts for Nazis", "INTERVIEWER 1: Were there specific hunts for Nazis, for SS men? SUBJECT: Were there hunts for them? Yes. This was left, most of the time, to the partisan groups, since they knew the local people, the local population, since they knew who to ask and who would tell them where they are hiding, or where they are, or what they are. "], ["not going back to Poland", "INTERVIEWER 2: Did you ever want to go back-- did you go back? You-- SUBJECT: No. I never would. I never will, no matter what. "], ["Israel", "INTERVIEWER 2: Did you, did you-- I know, but did you think of going to Israel? SUBJECT: Yes. I will. INTERVIEWER 2: Did you-- SUBJECT: I haven't been there yet. INTERVIEWER 2: You didn't think of going after the war? You were a fighter. SUBJECT: Yes, that's a very good question. When we were in Eschwege, the displaced persons camp, I was contacted by the Haganah. Again, somehow, in some way, I wind up always either in law enforcement, or military, or something that is, perhaps-- from childhood on, I was driven to it with some type of an emotional desire to be in this type of a condition or situation. When I was in Eschwege, there were about over 2,000 displaced people, displaced persons-- Jews, primarily-- who were waiting for quotas, either from Israel or the United States, to be taken out of there. Somehow, and I still don't know how or why, I was appointed as police chief of that group, because we had our own police force. We had to police ourselves. The camp was in a army camp during World War II. There was an army camp there. And then when the camp was vacated, all the facilities were left and then utilized for the displaced people. So I wind up, and I still have pictures of that, as chief of police of Eschwege. I had my own motorcycle, and I had 2, or 3, or 4, or 5 other policemen that were working with me. And we kept law and order as the best way we could. INTERVIEWER 2: 14 years old. SUBJECT: Everybody thought at that time I was 18, 15, 19. I was wearing high-riding boots, you know, with those Russian cavalry pants, you know, hanging out, riding pants, and everything else, and-- OK, when the time came, and I was approached by the Haganah, do I want to go to Israel? I said yes, without reluctance. They said, but we want you to understand one thing. It's only you. This was during the illegal time of immigration. It's only you. We cannot take your parents with you at this time. Maybe later on, they will. But right now, we need guys like you. And it was an extremely, extremely painful and difficult decision for me to make. After finding my parents and living through with them as much as we have, do I separate now into unbeknown destiny? Will I ever be able to see them ever again?"]]
